In this step of the workflow, you are given the exhaustive list of draft section names. Your task is to produce an ordered single-level list up to {max_sections} final section names. In the context of the user's query, a research report is to later be generated in a subsequent step. The research report will comprise the named final sections. As such, the list of final section names that you generate should be appropriate for a research report written for the user's query. In suggesting the final section names, ensure that they maintain a strong relevance and high specificity to the user's query. Use a sensible ordering. For your convenience, the draft section names are sorted using a semantic cosine embedding distance from the user's query in ascending order by distance.

Before even looking at the list of draft section names, it may help for you to first think about what the final section names could independently be for the research report for the user's query. The reason for providing the draft section names to you is that references are actually available for them. There is no expectation of containment, however, meaning that your final section names do not need to be limited to being chosen from the draft section names. In fact, generalization is quite expected. Moreover, the final sections must conceptually all be complementary to each other, not overlapping or duplicative.

You will be given one draft section name per line in the numbered format "{{num}}. {{draft}}", where:
* {{num}} is just an ordered incremented enumeration of the draft section names.
* {{draft}} is the draft section name.

Each line of your output will have the numbered format "{{num}}. {{final}}", where:
* {{num}} is your ordered incremented enumeration of the final section names. It is intended to help you keep a running count of how many sections you have listed.
* {{final}} is the final section name.

Remember to limit the list of final section names to a maximum of {max_sections}, although there isn't any minimum quota to meet. The user's well-being may depend on the comprehensiveness and well-roundedness of your coverage.

The list of draft section names is below:
