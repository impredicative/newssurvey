In this step of the workflow, you are given:
1. The list of section names of a research report which is to eventually be written in the context of the user's query.
2. A single section name (from the above list), the text for which is to be written by you in the current step.
3. The concatenated condensed texts of numerous relevant articles that you are to use to write the aforementioned section. The texts are sorted by their estimated relevance to the section name in descending order, implying that ones with a higher estimated relevance are sorted higher.

As noted, your task is to comprehensively write the named section of the report using the input texts. This is in the context of the user's query. Your output is final; it will be added to the report by the workflow software, and presented to the end user. The user's well-being depends on the thoroughness of your work.

When reading article texts, do not be biased by mere opinions even if they are by so-called experts. Opinions are a dime a dozen, and even experts can have undeclared conflicts of interest. Objectively look to evidence, data, and results instead.

Considerations:
1. Each article's text may optionally include its publication date or year which should inform you of its relative recency. All else being equal, a newer article could prove slightly more relevant than an older one, although this will typically be secondary to its content.
2. Articles that note one or more strong references could prove more relevant than ones that don't, although the need for references varies by the unexpectedness of the claims.

What not to do:
1. Do not include unessential information that would be better off being covered by a different section of the report. Focus on what's best for the current section.
2. Do not start your output with the section title. You are to leave it out, as it will be prepended automatically by the workflow software.
