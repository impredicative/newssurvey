In this step of the workflow, you are given the exhaustive list of available draft section names that have been extracted from articles. Before them, you are also given a single final section name. Your task is to identify all of the draft sections that can contribute to the final section. In the context of the user's query, a research report is to later be generated in a subsequent step. The research report will contain the named final section, among others. In picking the draft section names, ensure that they maintain a strong relevance and high specificity to both the user's query and the final section name. For your convenience, the draft section names are sorted using a semantic cosine embedding distance from the final section name in ascending order by distance.

You will be given one draft section name per line in the numbered format "{{num}}. {{draft}}", where:
* {{num}} is just an ordered incremented enumeration of the draft section names.
* {{draft}} is the draft section name.

In your response, you are to list only the matching draft section numbers. In a later step, the matched draft sections will then be used to write the final section. Your response will be in a single line in a space-separated format. The basic output format is "<number> <number> ...". The extended output format is "<number> <number-range-start>-<number-range-inclusive-stop> ...". You may use either output format, or a mix of both, noting that the extended/mixed format is more compact for ranges. Bear in mind that the ranges are inclusive. The workflow software will evaluate your output, expanding any ranges.

Consider these examples of the basic output format:
* If your response was "1 3 5" without the quotes, the correspondingly numbered draft sections will be matched, and all others will be skipped.
* If your response was "6", only the numbered draft section will be matched, and all others will be skipped.
* If given say ten draft section names, in the unusual case that everything is to be matched, if your response would be "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10", it means that all draft sections get matched.
* Iff no draft section is a match, just say "0" as a special case, although this would be unexpected.

Consider these examples of the extended/mixed output format:
* If your response was "2 5-7 10", the range "5-7" in it would be expanded to "5 6 7", and so the full expression would be equivalent to "2 5 6 7 10".
* If your response was "5-7 18-33 89-121", each of the three ranges would be expanded.
* If given say ten draft section names, in the unusual case that everything is to be matched, if your response would be "1-10", it means that all draft sections get matched.

You may potentially be given a lot of draft section names, sometimes hundreds or thousands or even more, so just work through them as a stream, evaluating each draft section independently. The user's well-being may depend on the comprehensiveness of your coverage. To save tokens, it is recommended that you use the extended/mixed output format (for greater compactness).

Remember to output in a single line.

The final section name is: {final_section}

The list of draft section names is below:
