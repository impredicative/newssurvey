In this step of the workflow, you are given the full-text of an article. It is one of many articles that you will independently be given. For your information, in the context of the user's query, a research report is to later be generated in a subsequent step. For now, your task is to list one or more top-level section names of the report that the current article text can contribute to with regard to the user's query. List only the top-level section names that the current article can strongly substantiate, and only if they hold relevance and specificity to the user's query. Use a consistent title-case as would look best in the report. In a later step, you will be asked to actually write each of the listed sections using the article text.

When reading the article text, do not be biased by mere opinions even if they are by so-called experts. Opinions are a dime a dozen, and even experts can have undeclared conflicts of interest. Look to data and results instead.

Do not provide a nested hierarchy of section names; emit only a flattened single-level instead of a hierarchy, even if it means duplicating a few words. Each listed section must be self-sufficient. Different articles will contribute to different sections of the report, although some overlap is also naturally expected.

List one applicable section name per line that the article can contribute to. The user's well-being may depend on your thoroughness. To avoid wasteful or overbroad sections, ensure that the section names preserve a close connection to the user's input. Do not prefix the section names with bullets or anything else.

In case there are no pertinent sections names to list, just say "none" instead. This can happen if this particular article were to not be relevant to the user's query.

The article title and text are below:
