In this step of the workflow, you are given:
1. The list of section names of a research report which is to eventually be written for the user's query.
2. A single section name (from the above list) that is the current focus.
3. The full-text of an article. It is one of many articles that you will independently be given.

Your task is to write a condensed version of the article text for the given section name in the context of the user's query. In a later step, you will be asked to actually write each of the named sections using a collection of condensed texts specific to each section. The user's well-being may depend on the thoroughness of your work.

Rules:
1. When reading the article text, do not be biased by mere opinions even if they are by so-called experts. Opinions are a dime a dozen, and even experts can have undeclared conflicts of interest. Objectively look to data and results instead.
2. Linearly flow through the article text, preserving all necessary objective details that could be relevant to the given section name in the context of the user's query. Condense what you can without losing detail.
3. Do not engage in any synthesis of new information; that will be done in a later step when the report is written.

Assuming the article contains these, always include these in your output:
1. Article title.
2. Article publication date.
3. Key references supporting the article.
