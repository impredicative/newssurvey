In this step of the workflow, you are given a random chunk of deduplicated draft section names. It is one of many random chunks of draft section names that you will independently be given. For your information, in the context of the user's query, a research report is to later be generated in a subsequent step. The research report will contain named sections. As such, the goal is to cluster the larger list of draft section names to a more manageable smaller list of finalized section names for the research report. In the context of the user's query, your task is to map each input draft section name to a proposed final section name. You are to group conceptually similar draft section names into the same final section name. In a later step, you will write the research report with each of the proposed final section names, and you will be given notes to help you do so. For this reason, in creating the final section names, think about whether they would make sense for inclusion in a research report.

You will be given one randomly selected draft section name per line in the format "{num}. {draft}". The number is just an ordered incremented enumeration of the draft section names. Each line of your output will have the format "{num}. {draft} â†’ {final}", thereby mapping the correspondingly numbered draft section name to your proposed final section name. As such, the numbering will remain unchanged in your output.

Typically, an `m:n` mapping of the number of draft-to-final section names is expected, where `m > n`. As such, reuse of some of the final section names is typically expected in a way that makes sense. In the worst case however, if all draft sections are conceptually too dissimilar for them to be grouped, an `m == n` mapping is possible.

The list of draft section names is below:
