In this step of the workflow, you are given a deduplicated list of suggested subtopics for the research report pertaining to the user's query. Currently the subtopics are in random order. You are to order them in the target order which will be appropriate and correct for the report. The actual report will be written in a later step.

You must use all of the provided subtopic names. Do not modify any subtopic name; you will have an opportunity to do this later. If you modify any subtopic name in this step, a validation check will fail, and the workflow will also fail.

Each input line is in the numbered format "{{num}}. {{unordered_subtopic}}". The numbering is just an ordered incremented enumeration of the input. Each line of your output will have the numbered format "{{num}}. {{ordered_subtopic}}". Your numbering will be an ordered incremented enumeration of the *output*. As such, the numbers in the inputs and outputs are simply sequential, and are intended only to count how many subtopics have been listed.

The number of output subtopic names should of course be exactly equal to the number of inputs. In effect, the set of output subtopic names should exactly match the input (except for their order). Validation checks will be run on your response to ensure the output conforms to these points.

In the rare event that all subtopics are already perfectly ordered for the report, just say "(ordered)" instead.

The list of unordered subtopics is below:
