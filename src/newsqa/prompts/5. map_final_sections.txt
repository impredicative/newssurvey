In this step of the workflow, you are given:
1. The full list of final section names meant for the research report, in the order they are to appear in the report.
2. A single final section name (from the above list) that is the current focus.
3. The exhaustive list of draft section names that have been extracted from articles.

Your task is to identify all of the draft sections that can contribute to writing the current final section. In the context of the user's query, a research report is to later be generated in a subsequent step. The research report will contain all named final sections. In picking the draft section names for the current final section, ensure that they maintain a strong relevance and high specificity to both the user's query and the current final section name. For your convenience, the draft section names are sorted using a semantic cosine embedding distance from the current final section name in ascending order by distance.

## Format
For your contextual reference and holistic understanding, you will be given one final section name per line in the numbered format "{{num}}. {{section}}", where:
* {{num}} is just an ordered incremented enumeration of the final section names.
* {{section}} is the final section name.

Similarly, you will importantly be given one draft section name per line in the same numbered format "{{num}}. {{section}}", where:
* {{num}} is just an ordered incremented enumeration of the draft section names.
* {{section}} is the draft section name.

In your response, you are to list only the matching draft section numbers. In a later step, the matched draft sections will then be used to write the final section. Your response will be in a single line in a space-separated format. The basic output format is "<number> <number> ...". The extended output format is "<number> <number-range-start>-<number-range-inclusive-stop> ...". You may use either output format, or a mix of both, noting that the extended/mixed format is more compact for ranges. Bear in mind that the ranges are inclusive. The workflow software will evaluate your output, expanding any ranges.

Consider these examples of the basic output format:
* If your response was "1 3 5" without the quotes, the correspondingly numbered draft sections will be matched, and all others will be skipped.
* If your response was "6", only the numbered draft section will be matched, and all others will be skipped.
* If given say eight draft section names, in the unusual case that everything is to be matched, if your response would be "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8", it means that all draft sections get matched.
* Iff no draft section is a match, just say "0" as a special case, although this would be unexpected, and the final section would then have to be altogether skipped from the report.

Consider these examples of the extended/mixed output format:
* If your response was "2 5-7 10", the range "5-7" in it would be expanded to "5 6 7", and so the full expression would be equivalent to "2 5 6 7 10".
* If your response was "5-7 18-33 89-121", each of the three ranges would be expanded.
* If given say eight draft section names, in the unusual case that everything is to be matched, if your response would be "1-8", it means that all draft sections get matched.

You may potentially be given a lot of draft section names, sometimes hundreds or thousands or even more, so just work through them as a stream. The user's well-being may depend on the comprehensiveness of your coverage. To save tokens, it is recommended that you use the extended/mixed output format (for greater compactness). Lastly, remember to output in a single line.
