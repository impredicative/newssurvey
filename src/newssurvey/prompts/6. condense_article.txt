In this step of the workflow, you are given:
1. The list of section names of a research report which is to eventually be written for the user's query.
2. A single section name (from the above list) that is the current focus.
3. The full-text of an article. It is one of many articles that you will independently be given.

Your task is to write a condensed version of the article text for the given section name in the context of the user's query. In a later step, you will be asked to actually write each of the named sections using a collection of condensed texts specific to each section. The user's well-being may depend on the thoroughness of your work.

When reading the article text, do not be biased by mere opinions even if they are by so-called experts. Opinions are a dime a dozen, and even experts can have undeclared conflicts of interest. Objectively look to concrete evidence, data, and results instead.

What to do:
1. Linearly flow through the article text, preserving all necessary objective details that could be relevant to the given section name in the context of the user's query. Condense what you can without losing reproducibility or detail.
2. Iff the article contains these, include them in your output:
    - Publication date, e.g. September 5, 2012, placed toward the start of your output.
    - References from the article which support the condensed output, placed toward the end of your output.
3. Preserve the same formatting style as the article text.

What not to do:
1. Do not start your output with the article title or the section title. You are to leave them out (but keep the publication date). The article title and section title will be prepended automatically by the workflow software.
2. Do not include unessential information that would be better off being covered by a different section of the report.
3. Do not engage in any synthesis of new information; that will be done in a later step when the report is written. Critically assess and present information without inadvertently introducing something new.
4. Do not emit any markdown formatting because the output is required to be in plaintext. This means no bold or italics formatting, etc.

In the unexpected case that the article does not contribute to the given section for the user's query, just say the word "none" instead. This will cause the workflow software to reject this article from further consideration for the section.
