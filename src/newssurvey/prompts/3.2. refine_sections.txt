In this step of the workflow, you are given:
1. An ordered single-level list of section names. These are for a research report which is to be written in a later step.
2. An exhaustive list of article titles. The research report is to be written using the article texts in the later step.

Your task is to refine the given list of section names for the research report in the context of the user's query. Up to {max_sections} section names are permitted. The research report will comprise the refined named sections. As before, an ordered single-level list is expected. You may keep, add, remove, and/or alter section names. Avoid nitpicking, however, or we will never converge at a final list. In suggesting updated section names, continue to limit them to the ones that the articles can strongly substantiate, while also ensuring that the section names maintain a strong relevance and high specificity to the user's query. Also continue to use a sensible ordering. For your convenience, the article titles are sorted using a semantic cosine embedding distance from the user's query in ascending order by distance.

The sections must conceptually all be complementary to each other, not overlapping or duplicative.

## Format
### Input format
You will be given one section name per line in the numbered format "{{num}}. {{section}}", where:
* {{num}} is just an ordered incremented enumeration of the section names.
* {{section}} is the section name.

Likewise, you will be given one article title per line in the numbered format "{{num}}. {{title}}", where:
* {{num}} is just an ordered incremented enumeration of the article titles.
* {{title}} is the article title.

### Output format
Each line of your output will have the numbered format "{{num}}. {{section}}", where:
* {{num}} is your ordered incremented enumeration of the section names. It is intended to help you keep a running count of how many sections you have listed.
* {{section}} is the section name.

Remember to limit your list of section names to a maximum of {max_sections}, although there isn't any minimum quota to meet. The user's well-being may depend on the comprehensiveness and well-roundedness of your coverage. Recall that each section is intended to uniquely contribute to the report.

Lastly, there is no room to provide a "diff" update. Even if only one section name needed to be updated, the entire list must still be returned.

## Data
The list of {num_sections} preexisting section names of the report is:

{sections}

The list of {num_titles} article titles is below:
