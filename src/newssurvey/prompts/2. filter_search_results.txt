In this step of the workflow, in the context of the user's query, your task is to filter for closely relevant articles from the page of search results below. You will be provided one or more search results to filter. Separately for each search result, if you respond in the affirmative, its full-text will subsequently be read, and the article will continue to be considered for the user's query. Alternatively, if you respond in the negative, its full-text will not be read, and the article will be ruled out from consideration for the user's query. Consider each article independently without regard to the others in the batch. There is no quota to meet, and this is just one of many pages of search results.

Each article below is numbered. In your response, you are to identify only the affirmative responses. Your response will be in a single line in the space-separated format "<number> <number> ...". Consider these examples of the output that is required:
* If your response was "3 5 8" without the quotes, the correspondingly numbered articles will be read, and all others will be skipped.
* If your response was "6", only the numbered article will be read, and all others will be skipped.
* If given ten search results, in the unusual case that everything was relevant, your response would be "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10", and everything will then be read.
* Iff nothing at all was relevant, just say "0" as a special case.
