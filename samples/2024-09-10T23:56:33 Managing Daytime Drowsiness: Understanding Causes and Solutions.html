<h2 id="section-1">1. Introduction to Daytime Drowsiness in Adults</h2>
<p>Daytime drowsiness in adults is a widespread issue with numerous contributing factors impacting individuals' ability to function effectively during the day. One significant factor is insufficient sleep, which is pervasive in modern society, often attributed to lifestyle choices, work demands, and the prevalence of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-08-economic-burden-undiagnosed-apnea-billion.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Economic burden of undiagnosed sleep apnea in US is nearly $150 billion per year</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-06-napping-good.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Is napping good for you? If you do it the right way, researcher says</a><sup>]</sup>. Researchers have identified various external and internal influences that exacerbate this condition, indicating that both sleep duration and quality are critical to reducing drowsiness during waking hours.</p>
<p>Studies highlight that OSA, a condition characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep, affects a large proportion of the adult population. This disorder contributes to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), which is prevalent among those who experience it. The frequent interruptions disrupt sleep architecture, reducing the overall quality of sleep and leading to significant functional impairments during the day<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-3" class="citation-link"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-03-motor-vehicle-accidents-higher-people.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Risk of motor vehicle accidents is higher in people with sleep apnea</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-06-apnea-sudden-cardiac-death.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea increases risk of sudden cardiac death</a><sup>]</sup>. Moreover, OSA is associated with an array of health risks, including cardiovascular conditions, obesity, and metabolic issues, which further compound the challenges of managing daytime drowsiness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-5" class="citation-link"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-09-evidence-obstructive-apnea-brain.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researchers provide first evidence of how obstructive sleep apnea damages the brain</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-6" class="citation-link"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-apnea-heart-disease.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea sufferers more likely to develop heart disease, study finds</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Individuals with insufficient sleep have reported higher incidents of EDS, impacting their daily lives by reducing productivity, weakening emotional regulation, and elevating the risk of accidents. This underscores the need for consistent and uninterrupted sleep to maintain cognitive performance and overall health. Recent findings suggest that the biological demands of sleep cannot be fully met through compensatory measures such as naps or caffeine, as these provide only temporary relief from cognitive deficits caused by sleep deprivation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-coffee-nap-deprivation-psychologist-substitute.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Can coffee or a nap make up for sleep deprivation?

If you do it the right way, researcher says</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In addressing daytime drowsiness, it is crucial to consider the broader implications of disrupted circadian rhythms, which are often caused by factors such as irregular work schedules and lifestyle habits that oppose natural sleep cycles<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-8" class="citation-link"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-role-reversal-function-circadian-network.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A role reversal for the function of certain circadian network neurons</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-9" class="citation-link"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-12-night-shifts-disorders-workers.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Working night shifts is associated with sleep disorders in more than half of workers, study suggests</a><sup>]</sup>. Circadian misalignments have been linked to worsened mood, poorer physiological health, and increased risks for conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Maintaining a regular sleep-wake schedule that aligns with circadian rhythms can help mitigate these effects and promote better functional health<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-clock-risky-business.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Why living against the clock is a risky business</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-11" class="citation-link"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-05-disruption-circadian-rhythms-contribute-inflammatory.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Disruption of circadian rhythms may contribute to inflammatory disease</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the role of specific behavioral and lifestyle factors, including diet, exercise, and exposure to daily light variations, play essential roles in managing sleep quality and daytime alertness. For instance, engaging in regular physical activity has been shown to improve sleep patterns and alleviate instances of EDS by promoting more restful sleep. However, reliance on short naps or nighttime sleep aids as a primary solution may not be adequate and could potentially disrupt long-term sleep regulation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-12" class="citation-link"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-08-date-rape-drug-fda-rare.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">'Date rape' drug gets FDA approval to treat rare sleep disorder</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-13" class="citation-link"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-nighthere.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Exercise really can help you sleep better at night—here's why that may be</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, understanding the interplay between various factors affecting sleep and adopting comprehensive strategies to improve sleep hygiene and regularity is crucial for managing daytime drowsiness in adults. Research continues to emphasize the importance of prioritizing sufficient, high-quality sleep to enhance daily functioning and mitigate the health risks associated with chronic sleep deficits<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-americans-struggle-good.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Most Americans struggle to get good sleep</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-15" class="citation-link"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-06-obesity-depression-root-daytime-sleepiness.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Obesity, depression found to be root causes of daytime sleepiness</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">2. Understanding Circadian Rhythms and Sleep-Wake Cycles</h2>
<p>Circadian rhythms are fundamental biological processes that regulate sleep-wake cycles and various physiological functions within a roughly 24-hour period. These rhythms are orchestrated by the brain's internal timekeeper, known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in the hypothalamus. The SCN coordinates with peripheral clocks found in other tissues and organs, adjusting to environmental signals such as light and temperature, thereby maintaining synchrony with the external day-night cycle<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-16" class="citation-link"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-01-weight-loss-circadian-rhythm-important.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Weight loss: Why listening to your circadian rhythm may be important</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-17" class="citation-link"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-09-simple-blood-reveals-body-precise.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Simple new blood test reveals your body's precise internal clock to guide treatments, improve health</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-18" class="citation-link"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-02-reset-button-circadian-clock.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">New reset button discovered for circadian clock</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Exposure to natural light plays a vital role in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Light perceived by the retina is transmitted to the SCN, which in turn influences the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for promoting sleep. Melatonin synthesis occurs during dark periods, peaking at night to facilitate sleep onset and decreasing in response to light, thereby inducing wakefulness in the morning<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-19" class="citation-link"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-circadian-rhythms-brain.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Circadian rhythms help guide waste from brain</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-20" class="citation-link"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-12-protein-involved-alzheimer-buildup-linked.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Protein involved in removing Alzheimer's buildup linked to circadian rhythm</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-21" class="citation-link"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-05-master-clock-brain.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Keeping time: Understanding the master clock in the brain</a><sup>]</sup>. This light-dark cycle is essential not only for sleep regulation but also for maintaining various functions such as appetite, hormone release, and mood regulation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-22" class="citation-link"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-11-focuses-frontier-circadian-rhythms.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Research focuses on a new frontier in circadian rhythms</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-23" class="citation-link"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-03-midst-pandemic.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Seeking restorative sleep in the midst of pandemic and beyond</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Disruptions to circadian rhythms can arise from several factors, including irregular light exposure and lifestyle habits. Exposure to artificial blue light from screens at night can inhibit melatonin production, delaying sleep onset and affecting overall sleep quality<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-24" class="citation-link"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-12-light-emitting-e-readers-detrimentally-shift-circadian.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Light-emitting e-readers detrimentally shift circadian clock, study shows</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-25" class="citation-link"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-07-artificial-digital-devices-lessens-quality.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Artificial light from digital devices lessens sleep quality</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-26" class="citation-link"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-03-daylight-affect-health.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">How springing forward to daylight saving time could affect your health—and how to prepare</a><sup>]</sup>. Such disruptions are common in shift work scenarios, where individuals are required to work nocturnal hours, misaligning their internal clocks with societal norms. This misalignment can result in circadian sleep disorders, which are linked to various adverse health outcomes including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health disorders like anxiety and depression<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-27" class="citation-link"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-03-circadian-rhythms-profound-metabolic-output.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Circadian rhythms have profound influence on metabolic output, study reveals</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-28" class="citation-link"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-09-circadian-rhythm-disruption-common-mental.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Circadian rhythm disruption found to be common among mental health disorders</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-29" class="citation-link"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-10-clinical-guideline-clinicians-circadian-rhythm.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">New clinical guideline to help clinicians treat circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-30" class="citation-link"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-discovery-melatonin-key-role-rem.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Dream discovery: Melatonin's key role in REM sleep revealed</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-31" class="citation-link"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-07-twins-gene-mutation-linked-short.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study of twins discovers gene mutation linked to short sleep duration</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Understanding individual differences in circadian rhythms is also crucial, as people exhibit varied chronotypes, making some naturally inclined to be early risers while others prefer later activities (night owls). Chronotypes are partially determined by genetics and can influence dietary preferences, sleep quality, and vulnerability to disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-32" class="citation-link"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-11-night-owl-bad-health.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Is being a night owl bad for your health?</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-33" class="citation-link"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-05-women-resilient-body-clock-disruptions.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Women appear to be more resilient to body clock disruptions than men, says new research</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-34" class="citation-link"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-09-diabetes-circadian-lipid-rhythms-wrong.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Diabetes: When circadian lipid rhythms go wrong</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-35" class="citation-link"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-link-duration-diabetes-lifestyle-factors.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researchers find link between sleep duration and development of type 2 diabetes, despite other lifestyle factors</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Recent research has expanded the understanding of how circadian rhythms interact with metabolic processes. Over 60% of metabolites in the liver, for example, have been shown to be regulated by circadian clocks, highlighting the significant impact these rhythms have on energy metabolism and the timing of nutritional intake<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-27" class="citation-link"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-03-circadian-rhythms-profound-metabolic-output.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Circadian rhythms have profound influence on metabolic output, study reveals</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-36" class="citation-link"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-nutrition-metabolism-circadian-rhythms.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Nutrition influences metabolism through circadian rhythms</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-37" class="citation-link"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-05-circadian-clock-body-microbes-response.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Changes in circadian clock can alter the body's microbes and response to diet</a><sup>]</sup>.

<p>Moreover, age-related changes in circadian rhythms can influence sleep patterns. The rhythmic output of the SCN declines with age, contributing to altered sleep structures and increased daytime drowsiness among older adults. This phenomenon may be mitigated by interventions aimed at reinforcing circadian regulation, such as exposure to morning light, regular physical activity, and maintaining consistent sleep schedules<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-41" class="citation-link"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-07-evidence-age-related-decline-brain-master.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study shows new evidence of age-related decline in the brain's master circadian clock</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-42" class="citation-link"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-06-age-busy-americans.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Age 40 is when busy Americans get the least sleep</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-43" class="citation-link"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-insomnia-linked-brain-networks.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Insomnia linked to damage in brain communication networks</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-44" class="citation-link"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-01-midlife-disrupted-memory-problems.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Even in midlife, disrupted sleep tied to memory and thinking problems later on</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In summary, synchronizing lifestyle choices with the body's natural circadian rhythms by promoting consistent light-dark exposure, establishing regular sleep routines, and aligning eating patterns with the body's internal clock can enhance sleep quality and overall health.

<h2 id="section-4">4. Metabolic and Cardiovascular Risks Linked to Daytime Sleepiness</h2>
<p>Daytime sleepiness is intricately linked with numerous metabolic and cardiovascular risks, reflecting a complex interplay between insufficient sleep and its broader impacts on health. One of the significant concerns is the disruption of circadian rhythms, which plays a central role in managing various metabolic processes. Disrupted sleep patterns can lead to increased insulin resistance, potentially heightening the risk of type 2 diabetes and associated complications. For instance, research demonstrates that both short and long sleep durations correlate with adverse glycemic control and greater likelihoods of diabetes and hyperglycemia<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-35" class="citation-link"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-link-duration-diabetes-lifestyle-factors.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researchers find link between sleep duration and development of type 2 diabetes, despite other lifestyle factors</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-73" class="citation-link"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-12-billion-people-worldwide.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">One billion people worldwide stop breathing while they sleep.

<p>Further compounding these risks, sleep deprivation has been shown to influence hormonal balances, particularly those regulating appetite, such as ghrelin and leptin. This imbalance can lead to increased caloric intake, weight gain, and obesity, established risk factors for cardiovascular disease among adults in their mid-40s<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-39" class="citation-link"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-03-weight-gain.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Less sleep leads to more eating, more weight gain, research says</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-74" class="citation-link"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-methods-insight-daytime-people-apnea.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Novel computational methods provide new insight into daytime alertness in people with sleep apnea</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-31" class="citation-link"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-07-twins-gene-mutation-linked-short.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study of twins discovers gene mutation linked to short sleep duration</a><sup>]</sup>.

<h2 id="section-6">6. Optimal Napping Techniques for Better Health</h2>
<p>To optimize the benefits of napping and improve overall health, several key strategies have been identified. Firstly, research suggests that the ideal duration for naps should be between 15 to 30 minutes. Such short naps help mitigate the risk of entering the deeper stages of sleep, which can lead to grogginess or sleep inertia upon waking, and avoid disrupting nighttime sleep cycles that longer naps might provoke<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-103" class="citation-link"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-04-daytime-naps-odds-a-fib.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Long daytime naps might raise your odds for A-fib</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-96" class="citation-link"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-05-nap-day-doctor-youre-napping.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A nap a day keeps the doctor away: How to know if you're napping healthily</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-84" class="citation-link"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-short-naps-memory-productivity-stress.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Short naps can improve memory, increase productivity, reduce stress and promote a healthier heart</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-104" class="citation-link"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-07-nap-aware-pros-cons.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Enjoy your nap, but be aware of the pros and cons</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the timing of naps is crucial for maximizing their effectiveness. It is recommended to take naps in the early afternoon, typically from 1 PM to 3 PM, aligning with the natural dip in energy levels due to circadian rhythms. Early-afternoon naps can enhance alertness and cognitive performance without interfering with the ability to fall asleep later at night<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-84" class="citation-link"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-short-naps-memory-productivity-stress.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Short naps can improve memory, increase productivity, reduce stress and promote a healthier heart</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-96" class="citation-link"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-05-nap-day-doctor-youre-napping.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A nap a day keeps the doctor away: How to know if you're napping healthily</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-105" class="citation-link"><sup>105</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-05-boost-memory-mood-nap-short.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Want to boost your memory and mood?

<p>Strategic napping can also be a part of a comprehensive sleep hygiene routine, which includes maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and avoiding stimulants such as caffeine close to nap times. Engaging in a pre-nap routine, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, can also help facilitate relaxation and prompt the onset of sleep<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-84" class="citation-link"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-short-naps-memory-productivity-stress.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Short naps can improve memory, increase productivity, reduce stress and promote a healthier heart</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-107" class="citation-link"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-03-good-night-focus-deeply-foot.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Tips for a good night's sleep: Focus on good times, breathe deeply, get a foot massage</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, while naps provide an opportunity to alleviate daytime drowsiness and complement insufficient nightly sleep, they should not replace efforts to ensure quality nighttime rest. Improving nighttime sleep habits—such as keeping regular sleep hours, minimizing screen exposure before bed, and creating a relaxing bedtime environment—can reduce the need for daytime naps and maximize overall health and alertness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-108" class="citation-link"><sup>108</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-10-health-benefits-nap.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Are there health benefits to taking a nap?</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-104" class="citation-link"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-07-nap-aware-pros-cons.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Enjoy your nap, but be aware of the pros and cons</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-71" class="citation-link"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-groggy-afternoon-nap.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Feeling groggy in the afternoon?

<h2 id="section-8">8. Behavioral and Psychological Factors Contributing to Daytime Sleepiness</h2>
<p>Daytime sleepiness is intricately linked to a variety of behavioral and psychological factors that disturb sleep quality and lead to challenges in maintaining alertness. A significant aspect is the impact of sleep deprivation on emotional and cognitive functioning, which manifests as increased anxiety and decreased positive moods. Research spanning over five decades reveals that even minor sleep disruptions, such as staying up slightly later, can enhance anxiety and diminish positive emotional states, emphasizing the pervasive influence of inadequate sleep on mental health<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-126" class="citation-link"><sup>126</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-12-deprivation-happy-anxious-years.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep deprivation makes us less happy and more anxious, says review of more than 50 years of research</a><sup>]</sup>. Furthermore, social jet lag—stemming from a discrepancy between personal sleep preferences and societal demands—can result in consistent misalignment of sleep patterns during the workweek, contributing to extensive daytime drowsiness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-americans-struggle-good.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Most Americans struggle to get good sleep</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Chronic insomnia, which affects a notable portion of the population, is another significant contributor to daytime sleepiness.

<h2 id="section-9">9. Common Sleep Disorders and Their Impact on Daytime Functioning</h2>
<p>Common sleep disorders play a significant role in daytime functioning by contributing to excessive daytime drowsiness, impaired alertness, and various health complications. Two prevalent issues are obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insomnia, each manifesting differently but both profoundly impacting daily life.</p>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing due to upper airway obstruction during sleep. This condition often results in sleep fragmentation, causing patients to experience excessive daytime sleepiness and related dysfunction, such as reduced cognitive performance and mood disturbances. Research has shown that individuals with untreated OSA are at an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack and stroke<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-08-economic-burden-undiagnosed-apnea-billion.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Economic burden of undiagnosed sleep apnea in US is nearly $150 billion per year</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-134" class="citation-link"><sup>134</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-apnea-aging-therapy-method-mitigate.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea accelerates aging, but use of breathing therapy method can mitigate the problem</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-66" class="citation-link"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-09-disorders-heart-disease-factors.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep disorders may influence heart disease risk factors</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-68" class="citation-link"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-09-evidence-apnea-brain.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study provides more evidence that sleep apnea is hurting your brain</a><sup>]</sup>.

<h2 id="section-10">10. Diagnosis and Management of Sleep Apnea</h2>
<p>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a disorder characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep due to_upper airway obstruction, leading_to symptoms such as snoring, breathing pauses, fragmented sleep, and daytime sleepiness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-76" class="citation-link"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-06-apnea-worsens-heart-disease-untreated.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea worsens heart disease, yet often untreated</a><sup>]</sup>. Diagnosis and management of OSA are crucial for mitigating its significant health and quality_of life impacts.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of OSA typically_ involves a polysomnogram, which is a comprehensive sleep study used to monitor breathing patterns, heart rate, and oxygen levels during sleep. This is often considered the gold standard for diagnosing OSA. However, advancements in sleep medicine have led to the development of effective home sleep apnea testing options, making diagnosis more accessible for patients who require flexible options compared to traditional in-laboratory testing<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-73" class="citation-link"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-12-billion-people-worldwide.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">One billion people worldwide stop breathing while they sleep. Are you one of them?</a><sup>]</sup>. Contemporary approaches utilize various portable monitoring devices that track essential metrics, such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels, though supervision by healthcare professionals remains crucial for accurate assessment<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-152" class="citation-link"><sup>152</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-apnea.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Diagnosing sleep apnea</a><sup>]</sup>. While home testing can facilitate diagnosis, patients with significant comorbidities or those who do not obtain conclusive results via home testing may still require comprehensive in-laboratory polysomnography<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-153" class="citation-link"><sup>153</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-03-aasm-publishes-guideline-diagnostic-adult.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">AASM publishes new guideline for diagnostic testing for adult sleep apnea</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Treatment strategies for OSA are diverse and often tailored to the individual’s specific health status and the severity of their condition. The frontline treatment for moderate-to-severe OSA is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. CPAP works by delivering a continuous stream of air through a mask to keep the upper airway open during sleep, effectively preventing episodes of obstruction<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-154" class="citation-link"><sup>154</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-03-apnea-male-female-differences-cerebral-cortex.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea study finds male-female differences in cerebral cortex thickness, symptoms</a><sup>]</sup>. Nevertheless, adherence to CPAP can be challenging, and the discomfort associated with its usage often leads patients to seek alternatives or require additional interventions to improve their compliance<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-76" class="citation-link"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-06-apnea-worsens-heart-disease-untreated.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea worsens heart disease, yet often untreated</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In cases where CPAP therapy is intolerable or unsuitable, alternative options such as mandibular advancement devices (MADs) or surgical interventions may be considered. MADs are oral appliances that help_maintain airway patency by repositioning the lower jaw and tongue, which can be effective though generally perceived as less impactful than CPAP in terms of increasing oxygen saturation during sleep<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-137" class="citation-link"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-09-american-college-physicians-obstructive-apnea.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">American College of Physicians releases new recommendations for treating obstructive sleep apnea</a><sup>]</sup>. Surgical options, such as upper airway surgery or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, can significantly improve airway obstruction for some patients and are considered in cases where CPAP and oral appliances fail or are not preferred by the patient<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-135" class="citation-link"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-09-long-term-benefit-apnea-surgery-cpap.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study finds long-term benefit of sleep apnea surgery when CPAP is not the answer</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to these primary treatments, newer therapeutic avenues are being explored.

<h2 id="section-12">12. Therapeutic Interventions for Improving Nighttime Sleep</h2>
<p>Various therapeutic interventions can be employed to improve nighttime sleep quality, each offering distinct benefits and limitations. Among these, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has consistently demonstrated its effectiveness as a non-pharmacological intervention. It addresses maladaptive sleep patterns and the cognitive processes that hinder sleep, focusing on behavior modifications like sleep restriction and stimulus control, and often results in marked improvements in sleep quality and duration without the side effects commonly associated with sleep medications<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-128" class="citation-link"><sup>128</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-05-chronic-insomnia-docs-urged-behavior.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Chronic insomnia?

<h2 id="section-13">13. Exercise and Its Influence on Sleep and Alertness</h2>
<p>A growing body of research underscores the substantial role that regular exercise plays in improving sleep quality and enhancing daytime alertness. Engaging in physical activity is linked to beneficial effects on sleep patterns, including increased total sleep duration and efficiency. Specifically, aerobic exercises such as brisk walking, cycling, and swimming have been shown to improve sleep onset, reduce sleep disturbances, and enhance the duration of deep, restorative sleep stages<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-175" class="citation-link"><sup>175</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-03-week-term-linked-current-insomnia.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Consistently exercising 2–3 times a week over the long term linked to lower current insomnia risk</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-13" class="citation-link"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-nighthere.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Exercise really can help you sleep better at night—here's why that may be</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-185" class="citation-link"><sup>185</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-03-quality-dont-difference.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Exercise can improve sleep quality even when you don't perceive a difference</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Exercise regulates the circadian rhythms, the body's internal clock that governs sleep-wake cycles, thereby promoting a more consistent sleep schedule. This regulation is crucial for individuals experiencing daytime drowsiness as it can lead to increased alertness during waking hours<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-186" class="citation-link"><sup>186</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-11-body-clock-skeletal-health-scientists.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Exercise at consistent times could realign body clock for better skeletal health and performance, scientists suggest</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-45" class="citation-link"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-healthy-circadian-rhythm-sane-resilience.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A healthy circadian rhythm may keep you sane and increase resilience to fight COVID-19</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-187" class="citation-link"><sup>187</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-09-mouth-taping-medical-expert.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">'Mouth taping' not the answer for better sleep—'I do not recommend that practice at all,' says medical expert</a><sup>]</sup>.

<p>Regular physical activity helps in the production of melatonin, the hormone that induces sleepiness, and reduces the levels of stress hormones like cortisol. These hormonal adjustments help to enhance overall relaxation and facilitate deeper sleep, contributing to a reduction in the incidence and severity of insomnia symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-188" class="citation-link"><sup>188</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-breakdown-mitochondria-diabetic-patients.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A breakdown in communication: Mitochondria of diabetic patients can't keep time</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-123" class="citation-link"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-02-tuning-circadian-clock-boosting-rhythms.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Tuning the circadian clock, boosting rhythms may be key to future treatments and medicines</a><sup>]</sup>. Moreover, exercise acts as a natural mood enhancer by triggering the release of endorphins, which can alleviate stress and anxiety, further promoting high sleep quality<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-13" class="citation-link"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-nighthere.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Exercise really can help you sleep better at night—here's why that may be</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-189" class="citation-link"><sup>189</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-10-dont.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Why we still don't understand sleep, and why it matters</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The timing and intensity of exercise also play critical roles in its effects on sleep. Moderate exercise performed in the morning or early afternoon is ideal, as it can help enhance sleep without interfering with the ability to fall asleep at night. Conversely, vigorous workouts close to bedtime may stimulate the nervous system too much and disturb the sleep cycle, leading to difficulties in falling asleep<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-13" class="citation-link"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-nighthere.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Exercise really can help you sleep better at night—here's why that may be</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-79" class="citation-link"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-01-expert-shift-affects.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Expert explains how shift work affects your sleep</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, even when individuals do not subjectively perceive improved sleep, objective measurements often reveal increased sleep efficiency and quality following exercise.

<h2 id="section-15">15. Vitamin and Mineral Deficiencies and Their Effect on Sleep</h2>
<p>Vitamin and mineral deficiencies have a profound effect on sleep quality, which can contribute to increased daytime drowsiness. Essential nutrients such as vitamin D, magnesium, and B vitamins are pivotal in regulating sleep. Vitamin D, for instance, is closely linked to sleep quality; low levels of vitamin D have been associated with poor sleep outcomes, such as disturbances in sleep cycles and increased sleepiness during the day. Research shows that individuals with deficient vitamin D levels are more susceptible to sleep disorders, highlighting the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels for better sleep health<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-203" class="citation-link"><sup>203</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-12-significant-link-sleepiness-vitamin-d.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study is first to find significant link between sleepiness and vitamin D</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-americans-struggle-good.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Most Americans struggle to get good sleep</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-52" class="citation-link"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-habits-affect-weight.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">How sleep habits can affect weight</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Magnesium, a mineral involved in over 300 biochemical reactions in the body, including the regulation of neurotransmitters, is known for its calming properties that aid in sleep. Deficiency in magnesium can lead to disturbances in sleep architecture, manifested as fragmented sleep, insomnia, and consequently, increased daytime drowsiness. Magnesium also plays a role in melatonin production, the hormone that governs sleep-wake cycles, further linking magnesium to sleep regulation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-114" class="citation-link"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-03-expert-magnesium.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What an expert says about taking magnesium for sleep</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-52" class="citation-link"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-habits-affect-weight.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">How sleep habits can affect weight</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-204" class="citation-link"><sup>204</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-11-weekend-heart.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Catching up on sleep over the weekend may not help the heart</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-107" class="citation-link"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-03-good-night-focus-deeply-foot.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Tips for a good night's sleep: Focus on good times, breathe deeply, get a foot massage</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>B vitamins, including B6, B12, and folate, are crucial for maintaining healthy nervous system function and producing neurotransmitters that promote relaxation and sleep. A lack of these vitamins can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to insomnia and disturbed sleep-wake cycles.

<h2 id="section-20">20. Evaluating the Role of Genetics in Sleep Patterns</h2>
<p>Genetic influences on sleep patterns are substantial, shaping how individuals experience sleep duration, timing, and quality. Research increasingly uncovers the genetic underpinnings of circadian rhythms, which dictate sleep-wake cycles and influence behavior. One significant discovery is the identification of specific genetic traits linked to sleep and activity cycles, particularly evident in individuals with bipolar disorder. For instance, a study found that genetic factors could determine sleep duration, timing of sleep onset and offset, and overall sleep structure<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-235" class="citation-link"><sup>235</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-12-scientists-inherited-traits-tied.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Scientists detect inherited traits tied to sleep, wake, and activity cycles</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the connection between circadian rhythms and mood disorders suggests a genetic intersection where disruptions in one's natural rhythm might affect mental health. Specific genomic regions have been pinpointed, linking genetic variants to disrupted circadian cycles, which in turn are associated with mood disorders such as depression<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-197" class="citation-link"><sup>197</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-08-genetic-link-circadian-rhythms-mood.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Genetic link discovered between circadian rhythms and mood disorders</a><sup>]</sup>. Studies involving twins have illustrated that mutations in genes related to sleep, such as the BHLHE41 gene, can lead to unique sleep patterns, underscoring the role genetics play in how much sleep one needs. This mutation allows certain individuals to function effectively on less than the average recommended sleep duration and recover quicker from sleep deprivation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-31" class="citation-link"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-07-twins-gene-mutation-linked-short.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study of twins discovers gene mutation linked to short sleep duration</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Similarly, genetic variations in key circadian clock genes, such as PER2, also have profound impacts on sleep. These genes regulate the daily cycles of various physiological functions and disruptions or mutations in them can lead to sleep disorders<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-236" class="citation-link"><sup>236</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-disorder-mechanism-biological-clock.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep disorder sufferers may have help from mechanism regulating biological clock</a><sup>]</sup>.

<p>Exercise also serves as a powerful ally. Regular physical activity is correlated with improved sleep quality and can significantly reduce daytime sleepiness. Both aerobic and resistance training have been linked to deeper, more restorative sleep, highlighting the importance of maintaining physical fitness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-175" class="citation-link"><sup>175</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-03-week-term-linked-current-insomnia.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Consistently exercising 2–3 times a week over the long term linked to lower current insomnia risk</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-185" class="citation-link"><sup>185</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-03-quality-dont-difference.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Exercise can improve sleep quality even when you don't perceive a difference</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, exposure to natural light, particularly in the morning, helps set the circadian clock and can enhance alertness throughout the day. The timing and intensity of light exposure can therefore play a crucial role in regulating sleepiness and promoting a more stable sleep-wake cycle<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-americans-struggle-good.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Most Americans struggle to get good sleep</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-151" class="citation-link"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-04-dark-night-good-health.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A dark night is good for your health</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-217" class="citation-link"><sup>217</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-09-brighter-days-nights.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">New research shows that brighter days make for better nights</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>For individuals with persistent issues despite these interventions, professional medical advice should be sought to explore further diagnostics, including potential sleep studies. Tailored treatment plans addressing specific sleep disorders, whether through pharmacological or behavioral means, can offer additional support in managing daytime drowsiness effectively. Continuous collaboration with healthcare providers ensures that strategies remain adaptive and responsive to individual needs<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-76" class="citation-link"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-06-apnea-worsens-heart-disease-untreated.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea worsens heart disease, yet often untreated</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-256" class="citation-link"><sup>256</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-06-insufficient-cycleespecially-shift-workersmay-heart.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Insufficient sleep cycle—especially for shift workers—may increase heart disease risk</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-173" class="citation-link"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-06-apnea-patient-cpap-class.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea patient now sleeps well, thanks to new CPAP class</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, addressing daytime drowsiness comprehensively involves a constellation of interventions tailored to individual lifestyles and sleep behaviors. By prioritizing consistent sleep schedules, optimizing sleep hygiene, ensuring nutritional adequacy, integrating physical activity, and utilizing appropriate therapies, individuals can significantly bolster their quality of sleep and daily alertness, alleviating the need for compensatory naps and enhancing overall health.</p>
