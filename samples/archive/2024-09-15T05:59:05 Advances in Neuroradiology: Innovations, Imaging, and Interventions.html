<h2 id="section-25">25. Imaging Alzheimer's-like Symptoms in Concussion</h2>
<p>Research over recent years has deepened our understanding of the ways concussions can mirror Alzheimer's disease, especially when it comes to brain abnormalities and symptoms. One study revealed that patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) often exhibit brain abnormalities akin to early Alzheimer's dementia, particularly in the white matter of the brain, which is crucial for communication between different brain regions. This aberration is detectable using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a form of advanced MRI. DTI evaluates water molecule movement in the brain, particularly looking at fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of white matter integrity. Lower fractional anisotropy values in critical areas such as the parahippocampal gyri correlate with deficits in memory and other cognitive processes, hinting at potential Alzheimer's-like memory problems following a concussion<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-27" class="citation-link"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-06-concussion-patients-alzheimer-like-brain-abnormalities.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Concussion patients show Alzheimer's-like brain abnormalities</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, addressing the blood-brain barrier's role in the development of Alzheimer's-like symptoms following concussions has become a major focus. Research led by Dr. Alon Friedman emphasizes the importance of identifying damage to the blood-brain barrier in athletes subjected to repeated mild traumatic brain injuries. Through sophisticated MRI techniques, researchers were able to pinpoint blood-brain barrier dysfunctions that are predictors of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's. This method holds potential for formulating preventative strategies and treatment approaches for such at-risk individuals<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-26" class="citation-link"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-12-brain_1.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Protecting the brain</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Continuing this line of inquiry, another innovative technique allows for the non-invasive and nearly real-time visualization of the brain's waste-clearance system, facilitating a better understanding of Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injuries. This novel MRI approach has paved the way for visualizing brain lymphatic networks that play a pivotal role in clearing waste, which when impaired, could accelerate neurodegenerative conditions. This kind of imaging could be critical in assessing post-concussion brain health and understanding how the aging brain's clearance system impacts recovery<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-29" class="citation-link"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-02-non-invasive-real-time-visualization-human-brain.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A non-invasive and near real-time visualization of the human brain's waste-clearance system</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the gender of individuals suffering from concussions might affect their recovery times and exhibit differential Alzheimer's-like symptoms.
