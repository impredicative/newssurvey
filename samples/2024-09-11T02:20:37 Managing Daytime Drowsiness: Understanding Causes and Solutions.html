<h2 id="section-1">1. Introduction to Daytime Drowsiness in Adults</h2>
<p>Daytime drowsiness in adults is a prevalent issue that impacts various aspects of life, ranging from cognitive function to emotional well-being. It is often caused by insufficient nighttime sleep or poor sleep quality, and it can lead to significant health problems if not addressed adequately. This section highlights the primary factors contributing to daytime drowsiness and its implications on public health.</p>
<p>Insufficient sleep duration is one of the most direct contributors to daytime drowsiness. Many adults do not meet the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep per night, leading to sleep debt. This debt manifests through increased feelings of tiredness and a need for naps during the day, which can disrupt night sleep cycles further and perpetuate a cycle of poor sleep quality and excessive drowsiness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-07-scientists-uncover-compounds-affect-circadian.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Scientists uncover new compounds that could affect circadian rhythm</a><sup>]</sup>. Additionally, the effects of sleep deprivation extend beyond simple tiredness; they can lead to cognitive impairments like memory lapses, reduced attention span, and difficulties in complex problem-solving tasks. Sleep loss can also adversely affect emotional regulation, increasing irritability and susceptibility to stress and mental health disorders like depression and anxiety<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-coffee-nap-deprivation-psychologist-substitute.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Can coffee or a nap make up for sleep deprivation?

<p>Another central factor intertwined with daytime sleepiness is circadian rhythm disruption. The internal biological clock, which regulates sleep-wake cycles, appetite, and hormonal functions, can be thrown off by modern lifestyle influences such as exposure to artificial light, irregular work schedules, and inconsistent sleep patterns<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-clock-risky-business.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Why living against the clock is a risky business</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-5" class="citation-link"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-03-circadian-rhythms-profound-metabolic-output.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Circadian rhythms have profound influence on metabolic output, study reveals</a><sup>]</sup>. For instance, individuals working night shifts or experiencing frequent jet lag often report heightened levels of daytime sleepiness due to misalignment between their internal clocks and the external environment<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-6" class="citation-link"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-04-special-journal-issue-highlights-shift.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Special journal issue highlights shift work science, solutions</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-05-drivers-shift-disorder.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Drivers with shift work sleep disorder 3 times more likely to be in crash</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Sleep disorders play a critical role in exacerbating daytime drowsiness. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder marked by repetitive interruptions in breathing, leading to decreased oxygen saturation and frequent awakenings. These disruptions severely impact sleep quality, resulting in pronounced daytime drowsiness if left untreated<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-8" class="citation-link"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-apnea-heart-disease.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea sufferers more likely to develop heart disease, study finds</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-9" class="citation-link"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-09-cpap-therapy-symptoms-depression-adults.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">CPAP therapy reduces symptoms of depression in adults with sleep apnea</a><sup>]</sup>. Similarly, insomnia and restless legs syndrome can hinder a person’s ability to achieve restful sleep, thereby contributing to fatigue and somnolence during the day<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-07-links-restless-legs-syndrome-poor.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study links restless legs syndrome to poor sleep quality, impaired function in pregnancy</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-11" class="citation-link"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-americans-chronic-insomnia.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">About 1 in 8 Americans has been diagnosed with chronic insomnia</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, lifestyle and health factors like diet, physical activity levels, and mental health are intrinsically linked to sleep quality and daytime drowsiness. A sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary choices can lead to obesity, which is another risk factor for sleep apnea and resultant fatigue<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-12" class="citation-link"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-irregular-patterns-diabetes.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study finds irregular sleep patterns may lead to increased risk of type 2 diabetes</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-13" class="citation-link"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-03-weight-gain.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Less sleep leads to more eating, more weight gain, research says</a><sup>]</sup>. Mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, frequently coincide with sleep disturbances, further amplifying the challenges associated with excessive daytime sleepiness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-09-brains-habitual-short-sleepers.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Looking into the brains of habitual short sleepers</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-15" class="citation-link"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-11-disrupted-circadian-rhythms-anxiety-exacerbate.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Disrupted circadian rhythms may drive anxiety and exacerbate brain disorders</a><sup>]</sup>. For instance, disruptions in sleep can exacerbate stress, thus maintaining a cycle of poor mental health and further sleep instability.</p>
<p>Finally, the age-related decline in sleep quality also contributes to daytime drowsiness. As individuals age, they might experience changes in sleep architecture, such as decreased deep sleep stages, which are crucial for restoring cognitive functions, potentially causing increased daytime fatigue<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-16" class="citation-link"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-01-decreased-deep-linked-early-alzheimer.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Decreased deep sleep linked to early signs of Alzheimer's disease</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-17" class="citation-link"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-06-quality-duration-cognition-aging-populations.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep quality and duration improve cognition in aging populations</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Addressing daytime drowsiness fundamentally requires a holistic approach to improving sleep health. This can include behavioral strategies like setting a consistent sleep schedule, optimizing the sleep environment to enhance sleep quality, and incorporating relaxation techniques. It may also involve the management of coexisting health conditions and the consideration of lifestyle changes to bolster overall sleep hygiene and reduce the need for daytime naps<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-18" class="citation-link"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-03-natural-aids-fast-prescription.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Natural sleep aids: Get to sleep fast without a prescription</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-19" class="citation-link"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-09-links-obesity-poor.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study links obesity and poor sleep</a><sup>]</sup>. Ultimately, understanding and treating the drivers of daytime drowsiness are crucial for enhancing health outcomes and quality of life in adults.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">2. Understanding Circadian Rhythms and Sleep-Wake Cycles</h2>
<p>Circadian rhythms are fundamental biological processes that regulate the sleep-wake cycle, operating on roughly a 24-hour period, and orchestrating various physiological functions such as hormone release, digestion, metabolism, and alertness levels. These rhythms are synchronized with the external environment, primarily influenced by light-dark cycles. The central pacemaker of circadian rhythms in mammals is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) located in the hypothalamus. This master clock coordinates with peripheral clocks present in organs and tissues throughout the body, ensuring a harmonious rhythm that adapts to the natural day-night cycle<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-20" class="citation-link"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-01-weight-loss-circadian-rhythm-important.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Weight loss: Why listening to your circadian rhythm may be important</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-21" class="citation-link"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-07-evidence-age-related-decline-brain-master.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study shows new evidence of age-related decline in the brain's master circadian clock</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-22" class="citation-link"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-healthy-circadian-rhythm-sane-resilience.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A healthy circadian rhythm may keep you sane and increase resilience to fight COVID-19</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Healthy circadian rhythms ensure optimal functioning of sleep-wake cycles by signaling the release of melatonin, the hormone responsible for initiating sleepiness as daylight fades. Conversely, cortisol levels peak in the morning to promote wakefulness, illustrating the dynamic relationship between light exposure and hormonal regulation. Disruptions to these rhythms can lead to misalignment with the external environment, often resulting in sleep disorders, adverse health effects, and increased risks of chronic conditions like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-23" class="citation-link"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-09-caffeine-night-human-circadian-clock.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Caffeine at night delays human circadian clock, new study shows</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-21" class="citation-link"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-07-evidence-age-related-decline-brain-master.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study shows new evidence of age-related decline in the brain's master circadian clock</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-22" class="citation-link"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-healthy-circadian-rhythm-sane-resilience.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A healthy circadian rhythm may keep you sane and increase resilience to fight COVID-19</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-24" class="citation-link"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-09-simple-blood-reveals-body-precise.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Simple new blood test reveals your body's precise internal clock to guide treatments, improve health</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Circadian rhythms are not only vital for sleep regulation but also influence other bodily processes such as metabolism, blood pressure, and cognitive functions. Alterations in these rhythms can result from various factors, including lifestyle habits, work schedules, and age-related changes, impacting an individual's overall health and well-being. For instance, shift work or irregular sleep patterns can significantly upset the circadian system, leading to increased risks of metabolic disorders and impaired alertness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-25" class="citation-link"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-11-length-shift-linked-elevated-blood.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep length and shift work linked to increased risk of elevated blood pressure</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-26" class="citation-link"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-disruption-body-internal-clock-linked.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Disruption of the body's internal clock linked with mood disorders and adverse wellbeing</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-27" class="citation-link"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-05-disruption-circadian-rhythms-contribute-inflammatory.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Disruption of circadian rhythms may contribute to inflammatory disease</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The circadian system's resilience and adaptability can be enhanced by maintaining consistent sleep schedules, regulating light exposure, and aligning daily activities to natural circadian cues. Morning exposure to bright light can help reset the circadian clock, promoting better synchronization with external day-night cycles, which supports improved sleep quality and daytime alertness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-28" class="citation-link"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-04-dark-night-good-health.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A dark night is good for your health</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-22" class="citation-link"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-healthy-circadian-rhythm-sane-resilience.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">A healthy circadian rhythm may keep you sane and increase resilience to fight COVID-19</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Recent research highlights the complexity of circadian biology, exploring genetic, molecular, and environmental aspects that further define individual circadian preferences and needs.

<h2 id="section-3">3. The Impact of Sleep Duration on Health</h2>
<p>Sleep duration has a profound impact on overall health, influencing both physical and mental well-being. The recommended sleep duration for adults is generally between seven to nine hours per night, a standard set by various health organizations, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Shorter or inconsistent sleep durations are associated with a variety of health risks, including increased chances of developing chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, and even cognitive decline<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-32" class="citation-link"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-americans-struggle-good.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Most Americans struggle to get good sleep</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-33" class="citation-link"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-03-amount-night.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What happens when we sleep, and why we need just the right amount each night</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-34" class="citation-link"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-03-health-effects-rest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researcher sheds light on health effects of not getting enough rest</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-35" class="citation-link"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-10-critical-healthy-lifestyle.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Studies show how critical sleep is to maintaining a healthy lifestyle</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-36" class="citation-link"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-shorter-life-linked-higher-multiple.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Shorter sleep in later life linked to higher risk of multiple diseases</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-37" class="citation-link"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-link-duration-diabetes-lifestyle-factors.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researchers find link between sleep duration and development of type 2 diabetes, despite other lifestyle factors</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Chronic insufficient sleep can exacerbate the risk of developing metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. Numerous studies have highlighted that reduced sleep duration leads to hormonal imbalances affecting metabolism, appetite, and glucose regulation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-34" class="citation-link"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-03-health-effects-rest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researcher sheds light on health effects of not getting enough rest</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-36" class="citation-link"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-shorter-life-linked-higher-multiple.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Shorter sleep in later life linked to higher risk of multiple diseases</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-37" class="citation-link"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-link-duration-diabetes-lifestyle-factors.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researchers find link between sleep duration and development of type 2 diabetes, despite other lifestyle factors</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-38" class="citation-link"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-06-car-alzheimer-disease-dangers-deprivation.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Car crashes, strokes, and Alzheimer's disease: The dangers of sleep deprivation</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-39" class="citation-link"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-lack-diabetes.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Could lack of sleep increase your risk of type 2 diabetes?</a><sup>]</sup>. For instance, sleep deprivation has been linked to elevated levels of ghrelin, a hunger-stimulating hormone, while decreasing levels of leptin, an appetite-suppressing hormone. This hormonal imbalance can increase the likelihood of weight gain and impact insulin sensitivity, heightening the risk for obesity and diabetes<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-40" class="citation-link"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-habits-affect-weight.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">How sleep habits can affect weight</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-41" class="citation-link"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-01-affect-appetite.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">How does missed sleep affect your appetite?</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">4. Metabolic and Cardiovascular Risks Linked to Daytime Sleepiness</h2>
<p>Daytime sleepiness has been extensively studied in the context of its links to metabolic and cardiovascular risks. One of the primary mechanisms through which daytime sleepiness poses these risks is through its disruption of the circadian rhythm, which is the body's natural sleep-wake cycle that regulates various bodily functions, including metabolism and cardiovascular health. Disruptions in circadian rhythms can lead to a variety of health issues, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. It has been observed that insulin activity is regulated by the circadian clock, which suggests that not only the quantity and quality of food is important, but also the timing of meals relative to the circadian cycle. Eating during inactive phases can lead to glucose being stored as fat, whereas eating during active phases aligns better with the body's metabolic demands <sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-54" class="citation-link"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-circadian-clock-linked-obesity-diabetes.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Circadian clock linked to obesity, diabetes and heart attacks</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, chronic insufficient sleep has been linked with adverse effects such as insulin resistance and obesity, which are significant risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Sleep deprivation is known to elevate free fatty acids in the blood, creating a temporary pre-diabetic state. The presence of sleep apnea, a condition often associated with obesity and characterized by repetitive interruption of breathing during sleep, further exacerbates this condition by promoting insulin resistance and metabolic disruption<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-55" class="citation-link"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-02-links-loss-diabetes.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">New study helps explain links between sleep loss and diabetes</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-56" class="citation-link"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-05-severity-disordered-glycemic-health.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Severity of sleep disordered breathing predicts glycemic health</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Research has indicated that irregular sleep patterns, particularly those caused by shift work or inconsistent sleep schedules, can significantly increase the risk for metabolic disorders, including obesity and high cholesterol. This irregularity can also promote the development of atherosclerosis, a disease in which arteries narrow and harden because of plaque buildup, thus increasing the risk for cardiovascular events<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-57" class="citation-link"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-06-links-irregular-patterns-metabolic-disorders.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study links irregular sleep patterns to metabolic disorders</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-58" class="citation-link"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-02-chronically-disrupted-heart-disease.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study finds chronically disrupted sleep may increase the risk for heart disease</a><sup>]</sup>. Further, elevated blood glucose levels have been observed in individuals with chronic sleep deprivation and irregular sleeping patterns, indicating a disruption in glucose metabolism which is closely tied to cardiovascular risks<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-32" class="citation-link"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-americans-struggle-good.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Most Americans struggle to get good sleep</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-59" class="citation-link"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-wrong-sheep-individual-lifestyles-habits.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Counting the wrong sheep: Why trouble sleeping is about more than just individual lifestyles and habits</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Another critical factor linking daytime sleepiness with cardiovascular risks is the role of inflammatory processes. Sleep disturbances have been associated with increased production of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a marker of inflammation known to exacerbate cardiovascular diseases <sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-27" class="citation-link"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-05-disruption-circadian-rhythms-contribute-inflammatory.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Disruption of circadian rhythms may contribute to inflammatory disease</a><sup>]</sup>. Chronic inflammation is a well-known contributor to atherosclerosis and hypertension, further linking poor sleep with increased cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common condition leading to daytime drowsiness, is strongly associated with heightened cardiovascular risks, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart rhythms abnormalities, and stroke. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy, which is used to treat OSA, has been shown to reduce arterial stiffness, lowering cardiovascular risk <sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-60" class="citation-link"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-06-apnea-worsens-heart-disease-untreated.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea worsens heart disease, yet often untreated</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-61" class="citation-link"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-01-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-patients.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Continuous positive airway pressure therapy in patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In addressing daytime sleepiness and its associated cardiovascular risks, interventions that align internal biological clocks with external time, such as the strategic use of light therapy, meal timing, and consistent sleep schedules, can be highly beneficial in managing circadian rhythms and lowering metabolic and cardiovascular risks <sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-62" class="citation-link"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-uncovers-differences-sexes-circadian-rhythms.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Research uncovers differences between the sexes in sleep, circadian rhythms and metabolism</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-63" class="citation-link"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-10-circadian-rhythm-liver-gene-body.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Circadian rhythm: Liver gene helps body keep working smoothly after late nights and midnight snacks</a><sup>]</sup>.

<h2 id="section-5">5. The Role of Napping in Managing Daytime Drowsiness</h2>
<p>Napping plays a significant role in managing daytime drowsiness, especially for individuals experiencing insufficient nighttime sleep. It serves as an immediate yet temporary solution to alleviate the effects of sleep deficiencies, providing restorative benefits that enhance cognitive functioning, mood, and overall alertness. Research has indicated various physiological and psychological advantages associated with napping, particularly when it is strategically timed and of optimal duration.</p>
<p>The benefits of short naps, generally lasting between 20 to 30 minutes, include improvements in alertness, mood, and cognitive performance without the downside of sleep inertia—grogginess that can follow longer sleep sessions. These brief naps leverage lighter stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, thereby recharging the brain without disrupting subsequent nighttime sleep or promoting a cycle of insomnia. Short naps are also linked to enhanced memory processing and decreased stress levels, supporting productivity and problem-solving capabilities during the wakeful period<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-64" class="citation-link"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-03-naps-daytime-sleepiness-tied-greater.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Long naps, daytime sleepiness tied to greater risk of metabolic syndrome</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-65" class="citation-link"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-short-naps-memory-productivity-stress.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Short naps can improve memory, increase productivity, reduce stress and promote a healthier heart</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-66" class="citation-link"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-06-doctors-nurses-minute-power-naps.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Doctors and nurses need 20-minute power naps during night shifts to keep patients safe</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-67" class="citation-link"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-groggy-afternoon-nap.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Feeling groggy in the afternoon?

<h2 id="section-9">9. Common Sleep Disorders and Their Impact on Daytime Functioning</h2>
<p>Daytime drowsiness and impaired daytime functioning are often the result of various sleep disorders that disrupt normal sleep patterns and quality. Prominent among these disorders is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition where repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep lead to nonrestorative sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. OSA is prevalent, affecting up to 20% of adults globally, and is more common in individuals with certain risk factors such as obesity and craniofacial abnormalities. The condition causes fragmented sleep due to repeated arousals, leading to daytime fatigue, cognitive impairments, and an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-124" class="citation-link"><sup>124</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-12-sick-cpap-insights-apnea-diagnosis.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sick of CPAP?

<h2 id="section-11">11. Insomnia and Its Connection to Daytime Drowsiness</h2>
<p>Insomnia is often closely interlinked with daytime drowsiness, as the chronic lack of sufficient and restorative nighttime sleep results in increased fatigue during the day. The condition is characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, and sometimes involves waking up too early and not being able to return to sleep<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-149" class="citation-link"><sup>149</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-01-paper-highlights-insomnia-early-illnesses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Paper highlights need to identify and treat insomnia early to reduce risk of developing other illnesses</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-11" class="citation-link"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-americans-chronic-insomnia.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">About 1 in 8 Americans has been diagnosed with chronic insomnia</a><sup>]</sup>. Approximately 12% of Americans are affected by chronic insomnia, leading not only to nighttime sleep disturbances but also causing significant impairment during the day, such as fatigue, concentration difficulties, and mood disruptions, which contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-11" class="citation-link"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-americans-chronic-insomnia.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">About 1 in 8 Americans has been diagnosed with chronic insomnia</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>One compelling study discusses the involvement of insomnia in damaging brain communication networks, particularly the integrity of white matter tracts in the brain that play a crucial role in regulating consciousness, sleep, and alertness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-150" class="citation-link"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-insomnia-linked-brain-networks.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Insomnia linked to damage in brain communication networks</a><sup>]</sup>. These disruptions could explain why individuals with insomnia often experience cognitive impairments and mood disturbances during the day, exacerbating their sense of daytime drowsiness.</p>
<p>The link between insomnia and daytime drowsiness is enhanced when insomnia co-occurs with other conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), known as COMISA. People with this combination experience more profound sleep disruptions and are at a heightened risk of increased daytime sleepiness<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-135" class="citation-link"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-03-disorders-pills-required.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Hope for treating sleep disorders, no pills required</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-134" class="citation-link"><sup>134</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-12-common-disorder-combo-deadly.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Common sleep disorder combo could be deadly</a><sup>]</sup>. This is particularly problematic because untreated insomnia can perpetuate a cycle of inadequate rest that is difficult to escape, thereby impacting daytime functioning and people's overall quality of life.</p>
<p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) has been highlighted as an effective treatment. It helps address the underlying sleep issues, reduce insomnia symptoms, and subsequently improve daytime functioning<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-135" class="citation-link"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-03-disorders-pills-required.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Hope for treating sleep disorders, no pills required</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-127" class="citation-link"><sup>127</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-05-chronic-insomnia-docs-urged-behavior.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Chronic insomnia?

<p>Moreover, studies suggest that addressing insomnia can also prevent the onset of, or mitigate the impact of, associated health risks like depression and cognitive decline. For example, treating insomnia effectively with CBTi can reduce the risk of developing major depression in older adults, as insomnia often acts as a precursor to depressive symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-52" class="citation-link"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-11-insomnia-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-major.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study shows treating insomnia with cognitive behavioral therapy can prevent major depression in older adults</a><sup>]</sup>.

<p>It is critical to recognize that insomnia's impact extends beyond sleep itself, touching upon various health domains that induce daytime drowsiness. The persistent nature of insomnia can lead to a significant psychological burden, where the fear of sleeplessness itself becomes a driver of poor health outcomes<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-112" class="citation-link"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-11-people-insomnia-health-problems-non-worriers.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">People who worry about insomnia have more health problems than non-worriers, study finds</a><sup>]</sup>.

<h2 id="section-12">12. Therapeutic Interventions for Improving Nighttime Sleep</h2>
<p>Therapeutic interventions for improving nighttime sleep encompass a wide range of approaches, each tailored to address specific sleep disturbances and overall sleep quality. One of the most effective non-pharmacological strategies is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi). CBTi is backed by substantial evidence demonstrating its efficacy in treating insomnia by modifying disruptive sleep-related thoughts and behaviors. Digital CBTi programs, such as "Bedtime Window," have been shown to improve sleep outcomes significantly, providing a viable alternative for individuals unable to access traditional therapy due to geographical or logistical constraints<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-149" class="citation-link"><sup>149</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-01-paper-highlights-insomnia-early-illnesses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Paper highlights need to identify and treat insomnia early to reduce risk of developing other illnesses</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-135" class="citation-link"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-03-disorders-pills-required.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Hope for treating sleep disorders, no pills required</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-127" class="citation-link"><sup>127</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-05-chronic-insomnia-docs-urged-behavior.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Chronic insomnia?

Regular physical activity appears to enhance the duration and quality of sleep by regulating the body's natural circadian rhythms and promoting deeper, more restorative sleep stages, such as slow-wave sleep<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-171" class="citation-link"><sup>171</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-02-tuning-circadian-clock-boosting-rhythms.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Tuning the circadian clock, boosting rhythms may be key to future treatments and medicines</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-48" class="citation-link"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-02-neuroscientist-probes-role-memory.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Neuroscientist probes sleep's role in learning and memory</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Aerobic exercises like brisk walking, cycling, and swimming have been extensively studied and are particularly effective at improving sleep parameters. They not only help in reducing the time it takes to fall asleep (known as sleep onset latency) but also increase sleep efficiency<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-48" class="citation-link"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-02-neuroscientist-probes-role-memory.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Neuroscientist probes sleep's role in learning and memory</a><sup>]</sup>. Moreover, resistance training has also been found beneficial, particularly for older adults, in improving sleep quality through enhanced muscle strength and reduced inflammation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-155" class="citation-link"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-03-resistance-quality-inflammation-older-people.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Resistance training improves sleep quality and reduces inflammation in older people with sarcopenia</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Exercise aids in the production of sleep-inducing hormones such as melatonin, and decreases stress hormones like cortisol, facilitating a more relaxed state conducive to sleep<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-171" class="citation-link"><sup>171</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-02-tuning-circadian-clock-boosting-rhythms.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Tuning the circadian clock, boosting rhythms may be key to future treatments and medicines</a><sup>]</sup>.

<p>Importantly, exercise timing can significantly influence its effects on sleep. Morning or early afternoon physical activity can be beneficial, aligning well with the body's natural rhythms and promoting better sleep later at night. In contrast, vigorous exercise close to bedtime might have the opposite effect by increasing alertness and impeding sleep onset<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-48" class="citation-link"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-02-neuroscientist-probes-role-memory.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Neuroscientist probes sleep's role in learning and memory</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-172" class="citation-link"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-10-dont.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Why we still don't understand sleep, and why it matters</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The benefits of exercise on alertness are profound. Improved sleep resulting from consistent exercise leads to heightened energy levels and decreased daytime drowsiness. This is attributed to the increased duration of REM and deep sleep phases, essential for cognitive function and emotional regulation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-46" class="citation-link"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-03-added-heart-health.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep should be added as measure of heart health, study says</a><sup>]</sup>.

<h2 id="section-14">14. The Role of Obesity and Depression in Sleep Patterns</h2>
<p>Obesity and depression are critical factors that influence sleep patterns, contributing significantly to issues such as disrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Numerous studies highlight the intricate connection between these conditions and their impact on sleep.</p>
<p>Obesity often contributes to sleep disorders, particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by repeated interruptions of breathing during sleep due to airway obstructions. This condition is prevalent among individuals with obesity, as excess weight can lead to structural changes in the airway, increasing the likelihood of airway blockages during sleep<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-173" class="citation-link"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-05-role-obesity-depression-excessive-daytime.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Role of obesity and depression in excessive daytime sleepiness</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-144" class="citation-link"><sup>144</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-04-weight-loss.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">When weight loss helps with sleep</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-140" class="citation-link"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-08-economic-burden-undiagnosed-apnea-billion.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Economic burden of undiagnosed sleep apnea in US is nearly $150 billion per year</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-8" class="citation-link"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-apnea-heart-disease.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep apnea sufferers more likely to develop heart disease, study finds</a><sup>]</sup>. The relationship between obesity and EDS is also reinforced by a study from Penn State that indicates obesity is a stronger predictor of EDS than sleep apnea itself, with weight gain being associated with increased sleepiness and weight loss correlating with a reduction in these symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-173" class="citation-link"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-05-role-obesity-depression-excessive-daytime.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Role of obesity and depression in excessive daytime sleepiness</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Depression, on the other hand, is linked to various sleep disturbances, including insomnia and hypersomnia. Individuals with depression often experience poor sleep quality, which includes difficulty in both initiating and maintaining sleep. This contributes to daytime fatigue and sleepiness, which are common issues in those suffering from depressive symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-174" class="citation-link"><sup>174</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-01-patients-recovering-depression-memory-drug.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Patients recovering from depression show improvements in memory from the drug modafinil</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-173" class="citation-link"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-05-role-obesity-depression-excessive-daytime.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Role of obesity and depression in excessive daytime sleepiness</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-175" class="citation-link"><sup>175</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-06-obesity-depression-root-daytime-sleepiness.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Obesity, depression found to be root causes of daytime sleepiness</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-176" class="citation-link"><sup>176</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-06-duration-impacts-treatment-response-depressed.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep duration impacts treatment response for depressed patients with insomnia</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-9" class="citation-link"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-09-cpap-therapy-symptoms-depression-adults.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">CPAP therapy reduces symptoms of depression in adults with sleep apnea</a><sup>]</sup>. The condition of hyperarousal, where an affected individual's mental alertness persists even when attempting to sleep, is also noted in those with depression, explaining the increased levels of daytime drowsiness despite chronic sleep disturbances<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-173" class="citation-link"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-05-role-obesity-depression-excessive-daytime.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Role of obesity and depression in excessive daytime sleepiness</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-175" class="citation-link"><sup>175</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-06-obesity-depression-root-daytime-sleepiness.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Obesity, depression found to be root causes of daytime sleepiness</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The interplay between obesity and depression, therefore, creates a feedback loop where poor sleep quality can exacerbate depressive symptoms, and depression can further affect sleep quality, potentially leading to weight gain or preventing weight loss by increasing cravings for unhealthy foods. This is supported by findings showing that insufficient sleep can increase appetite due to hormonal imbalances like increased ghrelin levels and decreased leptin levels, which signal hunger and satiety, respectively<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-38" class="citation-link"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-06-car-alzheimer-disease-dangers-deprivation.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Car crashes, strokes, and Alzheimer's disease: The dangers of sleep deprivation</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-40" class="citation-link"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-habits-affect-weight.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">How sleep habits can affect weight</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-177" class="citation-link"><sup>177</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-effects-deprivation-healthy-snacks.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">To fight effects of sleep deprivation, reach for healthy snacks</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Inflammation is another contributing factor, as both depression and obesity are associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. This condition can be exacerbated by poor sleep and may increase EDS. Fat cells produce cytokines that may induce sleepiness, and inflammation is further aggravated by the lack of restorative sleep observed in those with both depression and obesity<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-173" class="citation-link"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-05-role-obesity-depression-excessive-daytime.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Role of obesity and depression in excessive daytime sleepiness</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-38" class="citation-link"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-06-car-alzheimer-disease-dangers-deprivation.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Car crashes, strokes, and Alzheimer's disease: The dangers of sleep deprivation</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-07-scientists-uncover-compounds-affect-circadian.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Scientists uncover new compounds that could affect circadian rhythm</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-178" class="citation-link"><sup>178</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-08-molecular-link-circadian-clock-disturbances.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researchers discover molecular link between circadian clock disturbances and inflammatory diseases</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Comprehensive management of these interrelated conditions is essential to improve sleep patterns. Strategies include the reduction of body weight through diet and exercise, which can alleviate OSA symptoms and improve overall sleep quality.

<h2 id="section-19">19. Cognitive and Neurological Implications of Poor Sleep</h2>
<p>Poor sleep is intricately linked with significant cognitive and neurological impairments, affecting processes such as memory, attention, and decision-making. Extended research shows that insufficient sleep can age the brain prematurely and diminish cognitive function. For instance, the cognitive decline linked with both inadequate and excessive sleep parallels the brain aging by about two years<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-216" class="citation-link"><sup>216</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-07-poor-age-brain.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Poor sleep may age your brain</a><sup>]</sup>. Chronic sleep deprivation can result in the irreversible loss of neurons, particularly those in the locus coeruleus, which are critical for alertness and cognitive functioning<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-217" class="citation-link"><sup>217</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-03-lost-neurons.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researchers show how lost sleep leads to lost neurons</a><sup>]</sup>. This neuronal loss illustrates a concerning aspect of sleep deprivation, emphasizing the brain's vulnerability to prolonged sleep deficits.</p>
<p>Regular disruptions in sleep, including conditions like insomnia, lead to significant cognitive challenges. Insomnia has been associated with alterations in the brain's white matter, essential for efficient communication between brain regions, ultimately resulting in cognitive declines such as memory loss and increased risk for depressive symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-150" class="citation-link"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-insomnia-linked-brain-networks.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Insomnia linked to damage in brain communication networks</a><sup>]</sup>. Furthermore, the inverted U-shaped link between sleep duration and cognitive decline suggests that both insufficient and excessive sleep durations can lead to cognitive impairments, highlighting that optimal sleep duration is crucial for maintaining cognitive health<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-218" class="citation-link"><sup>218</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-inverted-u-shaped-link-duration-cognitive.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Inverted U-shaped link seen for sleep duration, cognitive decline</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The connectivity within the brain's default mode network (DMN) can also be adversely affected by poor sleep quality, compromising cognitive functions involved in working memory and attention<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-190" class="citation-link"><sup>190</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-05-optimal-cognition-well-being.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Here's how much sleep you really need for optimal cognition and well-being</a><sup>]</sup>. Continuous inadequate sleep contributes to severe cognitive detriments that resemble the deterioration seen in aged brains or those inflicted by neurodegenerative diseases. Particularly, the ability to concentrate, remember, and execute precise tasks is diminished after just a single night of poor sleep<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-33" class="citation-link"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-03-amount-night.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What happens when we sleep, and why we need just the right amount each night</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Daytime sleepiness, often a symptom of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or insomnia, is another contributor to cognitive and neurological impairments. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk of cognitive deficits, linking to structural brain changes typical of dementia due to decreased oxygen levels during breath interruptions during sleep<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-219" class="citation-link"><sup>219</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-07-disorder-linked-brain-typical-dementia.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep disorder linked with changes to brain structure typical of dementia</a><sup>]</sup>. Similarly, insomnia, which impacts cognitive performance extensively, is linked to the deterioration of brain communication networks crucial for sleep, consciousness, and alertness regulation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-150" class="citation-link"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-insomnia-linked-brain-networks.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Insomnia linked to damage in brain communication networks</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, cognitive processing speed and memory, vital functions of cognitive health, can be severely impaired by inadequate sleep, further evidenced by the correlation of sleep quality with mental clarity and concentration. Research pointedly demonstrates that healthy sleep, characterized by consistent quality and adequate duration, defines improved cognitive health, including better memory retention and other executive functions<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-33" class="citation-link"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-03-amount-night.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What happens when we sleep, and why we need just the right amount each night</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Given these multifaceted effects, cognitive health interventions often highlight improving sleep quality and regularity. These are pursued not only to protect cognitive functions from decline but also to prevent the early onset of neurodegenerative conditions. The pursuit of optimal sleep, therefore, becomes a protective strategy against pervasive cognitive decline and neurological impairments linked to poor sleep.</p>

<h2 id="section-20">20. Evaluating the Role of Genetics in Sleep Patterns</h2>
<p>Genetics plays a significant role in shaping an individual's sleep patterns, with various genetic factors contributing to the regulation of the circadian rhythm—our body's internal clock that dictates the sleep-wake cycle. This biological timing system is primarily governed by genetic components like clock genes, including CLOCK, BMAL1, and Period proteins (PER1, PER2, and PER3), which regulate daily physiological cycles and influence sleep duration and quality. Mutations or variations in these genes can disrupt circadian regulation, leading to sleep disorders or irregular sleep patterns<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-220" class="citation-link"><sup>220</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-12-scientists-inherited-traits-tied.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Scientists detect inherited traits tied to sleep, wake, and activity cycles</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-211" class="citation-link"><sup>211</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-08-genetic-link-circadian-rhythms-mood.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Genetic link discovered between circadian rhythms and mood disorders</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-221" class="citation-link"><sup>221</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-disorder-mechanism-biological-clock.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Sleep disorder sufferers may have help from mechanism regulating biological clock</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-222" class="citation-link"><sup>222</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-10-circadian-mrna-affects-sleep-wake.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researchers identify structure in circadian mRNA that affects the sleep-wake cycle</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>For example, research has identified specific gene mutations that can alter sleep duration. The BHLHE41 gene mutation p.Tyr362His is associated with individuals requiring less sleep, allowing them to function effectively on fewer hours of rest. Such genetic variations demonstrate that while most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep, some can sustain wakefulness with significantly less due to their genetic makeup<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-223" class="citation-link"><sup>223</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-07-twins-gene-mutation-linked-short.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study of twins discovers gene mutation linked to short sleep duration</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Another major area of interest has been the connection between genetics and chronotype, the classification of people as "morning larks" (early risers) or "night owls" (late risers). Genes like PER3 have been linked to these sleep timing preferences, influencing when individuals prefer to sleep and wake. Genetic predispositions toward certain chronotypes can contribute to sleep misalignments with societal norms, often resulting in issues like social jetlag and increased risk for mood disorders<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-224" class="citation-link"><sup>224</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-05-depression-hour-earlier.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Want to reduce your depression risk?

<p>Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, are closely tied to disruptions in circadian rhythms, which are often genetically influenced. Research has identified shared genetic pathways between these conditions and sleep traits, suggesting that therapeutic interventions targeting circadian biology could potentially offer benefits for mood disorder management<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-211" class="citation-link"><sup>211</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-08-genetic-link-circadian-rhythms-mood.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Genetic link discovered between circadian rhythms and mood disorders</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-170" class="citation-link"><sup>170</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-06-genetic-links-neuropsychiatric-conditions-treatments.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Shared genetic links between sleep and neuropsychiatric conditions may lead to new treatments</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-225" class="citation-link"><sup>225</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-02-clock-gene-mood.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Clock gene may connect mood and sleep</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the interplay between genetics and the environment—such as light exposure, meal timing, and lifestyle choices—can affect sleep quality and circadian alignment. Genetic predispositions can exacerbate the effects of circadian disruption caused by external factors, leading to metabolic disorders and increased risk for chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-104" class="citation-link"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-01-resetting-metabolic-clock.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Resetting the metabolic clock</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-215" class="citation-link"><sup>215</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-12-nobel-prize-circadian-rhythm-field.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Nobel Prize: Circadian rhythm field poised for medical advances</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-226" class="citation-link"><sup>226</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-03-diabetes.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Too little sleep raises risk of type 2 diabetes, suggests study</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-12" class="citation-link"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-irregular-patterns-diabetes.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study finds irregular sleep patterns may lead to increased risk of type 2 diabetes</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Research continues to explore the epigenetic mechanisms that may also impact sleep patterns. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, can be influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors, potentially affecting the expression of genes related to sleep and contributing to conditions like excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-227" class="citation-link"><sup>227</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-05-explore-epigenetics-daytime-sleepiness.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researchers explore the epigenetics of daytime sleepiness</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-21">21. The Use of Pharmacological Treatments for Sleep Disorders</h2>
<p>Pharmacological treatments for sleep disorders offer a range of options varying in efficacy depending on the specific disorder being addressed. For conditions like excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and narcolepsy, certain wake-promoting agents such as modafinil and its derivative armodafinil are commonly used. These drugs have shown promise in enhancing wakefulness, although their efficacy can vary. For example, armodafinil has been associated with improvements in body composition and activity levels without significantly increasing blood pressure, although its impact on improving driving performance over time remains disputable<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-228" class="citation-link"><sup>228</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-drug-daytime-sleepiness-apnea.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Drug used to treat daytime sleepiness does not appear to improve driving in those with sleep apnea</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Solriamfetol is noted as one of the most effective treatments for excessive daytime sleepiness, particularly in OSA patients who do not fully respond to positive airway pressure therapy. Despite its effectiveness, it can elevate blood pressure, raising concerns for patients with concurrent cardiovascular issues<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-142" class="citation-link"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-05-wakefulness-promoting-agents-effective-excessive-daytime.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Researchers find best treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>For narcolepsy, new pharmacological treatments, like sodium oxybate, show effectiveness in managing both daytime sleepiness and associated symptoms like cataplexy. Lumryz, an extended-release form of sodium oxybate, offers an advantage by requiring only a single bedtime dose, potentially improving adherence compared to older formulations<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-164" class="citation-link"><sup>164</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-05-fda-lumryz-narcolepsy.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">FDA approves lumryz for narcolepsy</a><sup>]</sup>.
