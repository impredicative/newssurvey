## <a id="section-1"></a>1. Introduction to Anxiety and Nutrition

Anxiety disorders affect millions of adults worldwide, manifesting as persistent worry, fear, or nervousness, often without an evident cause. These disorders can significantly diminish quality of life, leading to challenges in both personal and professional spheres. As the prevalence of anxiety continues to rise, there is an increasing interest in non-pharmacological interventions, particularly the role of nutrition and diet in managing symptoms.

Numerous studies suggest that diet profoundly influences mental health, including anxiety. A nutritious diet can help mitigate the effects of stress and anxiety by stabilizing blood sugar levels and reducing inflammation in the brain. Certain dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, have been associated with better mental health outcomes. This diet, rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and fatty fish, is thought to lower the risks of anxiety and depression through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as well as its ability to positively influence gut microbiota [^1][^2].

The gut-brain axis, a bi-directional communication system between the gut and the brain, is emerging as a critical player in mental health. The gut microbiome, which is highly influenced by diet, plays a pivotal role in this communication. It produces neurotransmitters and interacts with brain pathways that govern mood and behavior. Diets that increase the diversity and beneficial function of the gut microbiome may enhance mood regulation and decrease anxiety. Foods rich in probiotics, such as fermented foods, have shown promise in reducing anxiety by improving gut health and thereby possibly influencing mental health outcomes [^3][^4][^5].

Specific nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, magnesium, and zinc, are known to be essential for brain health and mental function. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish, are crucial for neurotransmitter function and have been linked to reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression. Similarly, B vitamins are critical in serotonin and dopamine synthesis, with deficiencies often associated with mood disorders [^1][^6][^7]. 

Magnesium plays a role in anxiety management by modulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, which is often hyperactive in anxiety disorders. Studies have shown that individuals with lower magnesium intake may experience higher stress and anxiety levels. Zinc, while not as well-studied, also appears to have a role in mood regulation [^8][^9].

The link between nutrition and anxiety is still a developing field. As such, more research is required to better understand the impact of specific dietary changes on mental health. However, current evidence suggests that improving diet quality by reducing processed foods and increasing the intake of nutrient-rich foods, can be a powerful tool in managing anxiety, complementing traditional treatments and improving overall quality of life [^10][^11][^12].

## <a id="section-3"></a>3. The Role of Omega-3 and Anxiety Relief

Omega-3 fatty acids have been increasingly recognized for their potential role in alleviating anxiety symptoms and supporting mental health. Consisting primarily of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), these essential polyunsaturated fats are critical for optimal brain function and mental wellness. The human body cannot synthesize omega-3s, which necessitates their inclusion in the diet through sources like fatty fish, walnuts, flaxseeds, and fish oil supplements to meet daily requirements. Recent research highlights the multifaceted benefits of omega-3s in anxiety relief across various demographics and settings[^1][^15][^11][^3][^36].

One pivotal mechanism by which omega-3 fatty acids influence mental health is through their anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation has been linked to a range of mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression. Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce inflammation by lowering cytokine production, which in turn may lead to a reduction in anxiety symptoms. A study involving medical students demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety levels when participants supplemented with omega-3s, corresponding with reduced levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6)[^15].

Research has also shown that omega-3 fatty acids can enhance neurotransmitter function, particularly regarding serotonin and dopamine, both of which are critical for mood regulation and anxiety management. They contribute to improved neuron signaling and neuroplasticity, fostering better brain health and function[^37][^8]. Furthermore, omega-3s play a role in structural brain changes, such as increasing hippocampal volume, which supports cognitive processing, mood stabilization, and stress resilience[^1].

Studies indicate that omega-3 supplementation could provide protective effects against anxiety-related symptoms. This is seen in multiple populations, from adolescents to older adults, suggesting a broad applicability. For instance, diets deficient in omega-3s have been linked to heightened anxiety and behavioral problems in adolescents, emphasizing the importance of these nutrients during critical periods of brain development[^7][^16][^38]. Similarly, in older adults, omega-3s coupled with antidepressants have been found to reduce depressive symptoms and cognitive decline, illustrating their potential in managing age-related mental health issues[^14].

Moreover, omega-3 fatty acids are noted for their benefit in sleep quality, which is intricately connected to anxiety levels. Improved sleep from higher DHA intakes can potentially mitigate anxiety, supporting overall emotional regulation and mental clarity[^39].

Given these findings, omega-3 fatty acids present as a viable strategy to support mental health by reducing anxiety. Diets enriched with omega-3 foods or their supplementation could provide significant mental health benefits when integrated as part of a comprehensive dietary and lifestyle approach[^13][^36]. However, further research is necessary to optimize dosage and identify specific populations that may benefit most from omega-3 interventions in anxiety relief[^11][^3][^40].

The role of probiotics in anxiety and stress reduction is a burgeoning area of research that has shown promising results. Probiotics, known to enhance gut health through the microbiome-gut-brain axis, can have a profound impact on mental well-being. This connection is supported by a multitude of studies demonstrating the efficacy of probiotics in mitigating stress and anxiety symptoms through various mechanisms.

Studies involving animals, such as mice and zebrafish, illustrate the potential of probiotics in modulating stress responses. For example, Lactobacillus plantarum was found to diminish stress-related behaviors in zebrafish by altering genetic expression and enhancing neurotransmitter signaling, suggesting its efficacy in stress management and anxiety reduction[^41]. Similarly, experiments with mice have highlighted that specific strains of Lactobacillus, such as Lactobacillus intestinalis ASF360, significantly improve stress resilience and reduce anxiety-like behaviors by impacting the gut microbiota composition[^24]. These findings reveal that probiotics can potentially alter brain functioning and behavior by influencing neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and reducing levels of stress hormones through the gut-brain communication pathway[^42].

In humans, the consumption of probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains, has also demonstrated a tangible decrease in anxiety symptoms. For instance, individuals consuming the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum showed a notable reduction in depression scores, highlighting the interrelatedness of gut health and mood disorders such as anxiety and depression[^27]. Another study conducted on university students discovered that higher intake of fermented foods, which are rich in probiotics, correlated with reduced social anxiety, suggesting dietary approaches may offer complementary avenues for anxiety management[^43]. Moreover, in medical students, the regular consumption of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota showed decreased stress perception and lower salivary cortisol levels during exam preparation, emphasizing the stress-relieving benefits of maintaining gut health[^44].

The underlying mechanism through which probiotics exert their effects includes the modulation of inflammatory responses in the brain. Probiotics can induce anti-inflammatory proteins while suppressing stress-induced neuroinflammation[^45]. These microbial changes can lead to the production of neurotransmitters and chemicals associated with brain health, further supporting their therapeutic potential in reducing anxiety and enhancing emotional well-being[^46].

While the evidence is promising, further extensive research is needed to identify effective strains and optimize dosages for clinical use. Confirmation through human trials will enhance our understanding of probiotics' full therapeutic potential, ensuring their safe and effective usage in anxiety management strategies. Nevertheless, integrating probiotics through diet, utilizing fermented foods, or as supplements, presents a promising non-pharmacological approach to potentially bolster mental health and mitigate anxiety symptoms sustainably and naturally[^1].

This suggests that meeting the minimum dietary recommendations for fruit and vegetable consumption can have profound effects on mental well-being[^70].

Moreover, some studies emphasize the frequency of fruit consumption as opposed to quantity alone. Frequent consumption of fruits, even in smaller amounts, has been associated with reduced depressive symptoms and improved mental health outcomes. This pattern indicates that a consistent intake of fruits, potentially due to their antioxidant properties, is crucial for optimal psychological health and anxiety reduction[^71][^66].

In addition to these findings, research also suggests that poor dietary choices and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake may contribute to changes in brain structures such as the hippocampus, which play critical roles in learning and memory and are susceptible to stress and anxiety. Nutrient-dense diets appear to support hippocampal volume, indicating that proper nutrition is vital not just for immediate mental health but for long-term brain health as well[^72].

While the general consensus supports the beneficial impact of fruits and vegetables on mental health, some studies do point to the complexity of these dietary effects. For instance, while improvements in diet are generally positive, the specific benefits for anxiety, as opposed to depression, require further exploration, suggesting that additional research into the mechanisms of how diet affects anxiety is warranted[^73].

Overall, the body of research collectively points towards the significant protective effects of adequate fruit and vegetable intake against anxiety disorders. These findings advocate for public health strategies that promote increased consumption of fruits and vegetables as a part of comprehensive dietary recommendations to support mental health. Addressing dietary deficiencies could therefore be a practical and effective approach to mitigate anxiety disorders—benefiting not only individuals’ mental health but also their overall physical well-being.

## <a id="section-14"></a>14. The Connection Between Diet Quality and Anxiety

Recent research underscores a robust connection between diet quality and anxiety, suggesting that dietary choices have a substantial impact on mental health. Poor diet quality, characterized by high intake of processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats, has been consistently linked to increased anxiety symptoms. Conversely, diets rich in whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats provide mental health benefits, potentially reducing anxiety and depression symptoms[^50][^1][^3][^2][^74][^57][^6][^51][^70][^75][^76].

Several studies highlight specific diet-related mechanisms that may influence anxiety levels. For instance, diets high in refined sugars and simple carbohydrates can lead to blood sugar fluctuations, which may contribute to mood swings and increased anxiety[^2][^77]. High glycemic index diets can trigger insulin spikes and adrenaline release, hormones that can exacerbate anxiety symptoms[^2]. In contrast, a diet rich in fiber and complex carbohydrates provides a steady glucose release, stabilizing mood and potentially reducing anxiety[^78][^20].

Nutritional deficiencies also play an integral role in mental health. Deficiencies in vitamins such as B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids have been linked to higher incidence of anxiety disorders[^10][^37][^12]. For example, B vitamins are crucial for neurotransmitter synthesis, and their deficiency may impair serotonin levels, exacerbating anxiety[^47]. Similarly, omega-3 fatty acids, found in oily fish and certain plants, play a vital role in brain health, and their deficiency can lead to anxiety and depressive symptoms[^3][^7].

Moreover, the gut-brain connection is particularly significant, with the composition of gut microbiota influencing mental health through the gut-brain axis. Diets that foster a healthy gut microbiome, such as those rich in prebiotics and probiotics, can enhance mental well-being and mitigate anxiety symptoms[^79][^58][^56][^46]. Fermented foods, which contain beneficial bacteria, have shown promise in reducing social anxiety[^43].

The Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and lean proteins, is often cited for its beneficial effects on mental health, including anxiety reduction[^50][^51][^54][^53]. This diet is rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, which can protect against oxidative stress and inflammation, factors linked to mental health disorders[^50][^51][^53].

Additionally, maintaining consistent meal patterns and avoiding ultra-processed foods are important for managing anxiety. Frequent consumption of ultra-processed foods, which are often high in sugars and unhealthy fats, has been associated with higher incidence of anxiety disorders[^74][^75][^80][^29]. On the other hand, improving diet quality by increasing the intake of nutrient-dense foods can reduce anxiety symptoms[^1][^3][^13][^73][^36].

Finally, it is essential to consider individual differences, such as genetic predispositions and lifestyle factors, that may influence dietary impacts on anxiety. Personalized dietary interventions tailored to an individual's specific needs and health conditions could optimize mental health outcomes[^79][^6][^49]. Comprehensive approaches that include dietary modifications as part of anxiety management strategies are encouraged, emphasizing the critical role of diet quality in promoting mental well-being[^3][^79][^72][^81].

## <a id="section-15"></a>15. Potential of Saffron as a Mental Health Supplement

Saffron is gaining attention as a promising natural supplement for mental health, specifically in addressing symptoms of anxiety and depression. A recent 8-week double-blind study highlighted saffron's potential to reduce anxiety symptoms, including social anxiety, in adolescents. The study found that participants who received saffron tablets reported significant improvements compared to those given a placebo[^30]. This suggests that saffron may offer similar benefits for adults, particularly considering its minimal side effects compared to traditional treatments[^30].

The therapeutic effects of saffron are attributed to its active compounds, primarily crocin and safranal, which are believed to enhance serotonin production and reduce oxidative stress. These compounds may also have anti-inflammatory properties, which are beneficial since inflammation is often linked to anxiety disorders[^1]. Such mechanisms position saffron as a potential natural alternative to pharmaceutical anxiolytics and antidepressants[^1].

Moreover, an extensive review on nutritional supplements and mental health supports the safety of saffron when used at appropriate dosages, making it a viable option for individuals seeking complementary treatments alongside conventional therapies[^13]. Although saffron was not specifically highlighted in the review's summary, its potential benefits warrant further investigation into its mechanisms and interactions with mental health conditions[^13].

Clinical trials have suggested that saffron can produce antidepressant and anxiolytic effects akin to those of some conventional medications, with doses between 30 to 200 mg per day proving effective without significant side effects[^1]. Despite the promising results, ongoing research is necessary to fully understand saffron's effectiveness across various demographic groups and to elucidate its mechanisms of action. Nevertheless, current evidence positions saffron as a promising natural supplement for managing anxiety[^1].

## <a id="section-16"></a>16. Folic Acid and Methyl Donors in Anxiety Management

Methyl donors, including folic acid, have shown promising potential in managing anxiety by addressing oxidative stress and aiding neurotransmitter synthesis. Research indicates that methyl donors can mitigate anxiety-like symptoms by normalizing oxidative stress in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved in mood regulation. A study conducted on rats fed a high fructose diet, known to increase oxidative stress and anxiety symptoms, demonstrated that supplementation with methyl donors could normalize these behaviors, suggesting potential benefits for treating anxiety in humans as well[^67].

Folic acid, a type of folate, plays a critical role in brain health due to its involvement in neurotransmitter synthesis, specifically serotonin, which is integral to mood regulation. Deficiencies in folate have been linked to increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, underscoring the importance of adequate folic acid intake for emotional well-being. Studies have consistently shown that folic acid supplementation can improve mental health outcomes, particularly in individuals with anxiety disorders[^3]. The role of additional methyl donors, like choline and methionine, further supports the neuroprotective functions necessary for effective anxiety management[^3].

Folic acid's presence in foods such as whole grains, dark green vegetables, and legumes highlights the importance of diet in maintaining mental health. Ensuring adequate folate intake supports neurotransmitter production, offering potential relief from anxiety symptoms. This aligns with the Finnish Current Care Guidelines for Depression, which advocate for assessing nutrient levels, including folate, in individuals with treatment-resistant depression[^1]. By addressing nutrient deficiencies through supplementation or diet, one can potentially improve mood and cognitive function[^1].

While a broad review of nutritional studies suggested that many supplements did not significantly enhance mental health, folic acid was identified as a nutrient with notable benefits for mood disorders, including anxiety. Importantly, adherence to recommended dosages has shown no significant adverse effects, highlighting the safe integration of folic acid into treatment plans when used suitably alongside psychiatric medications[^13]. Continued research is essential to fully elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of folic acid and identify those who might benefit the most from its supplementation in anxiety management[^13].

## <a id="section-17"></a>17. Relationship Between Diet, Exercise, and Mental Health in Adults

The relationship between diet, exercise, and mental health in adults is intricate and multifaceted, involving several biological, psychological, and lifestyle factors. Dietary habits directly influence mental health by affecting mood, behavior, and cognitive function. A balanced diet rich in whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, is associated with better mental health outcomes, including reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression[^10][^1][^36][^2]. This is partly due to the impact of these nutrients on brain chemistry and neurotransmitter balance, as well as inflammation control[^8]. Conversely, consumption of ultra-processed foods has been linked to an increased risk of depression, underlying the importance of dietary quality in mental well-being[^29].

Exercise is a critical component of mental health, offering physiological and psychological benefits. Regular physical activity helps mitigate symptoms of anxiety and depression by releasing endorphins and reducing stress hormones like cortisol[^54][^43][^82]. It also improves resilience to daily stressors and emotional disturbances, enhancing overall mental health[^83]. Moreover, combining dietary improvements with exercise amplifies the positive effects on mood and mental well-being, suggesting a synergistic relationship between the two[^73][^84]. 

Addressing diet and exercise concurrently offers a holistic approach to mental health management. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly of vitamins and minerals such as B vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and magnesium, can exacerbate anxiety and depressive symptoms, emphasizing the need for a nutrient-rich diet to sustain mental health[^8][^47][^34]. The regular practice of physical activity creates a supportive framework for dietary interventions, promoting neurotransmitter synthesis, energy metabolism, and cellular health that underpin emotional stability[^64][^82].

Research shows that the interaction between diet and exercise also has implications for demographic-specific recommendations, such as tailoring interventions based on age, gender, and biological needs[^79][^85]. For instance, women may benefit more from a comprehensive nutrient intake combined with physical activity for sustaining mental health compared to men, highlighting gender differences in diet-related emotional well-being[^79][^85].

In conclusion, the role of diet and exercise in mental health cannot be understated. Both factors contribute significantly to the regulation of mood and stress responses. They provide essential nutrients, promote physical health, and enhance psychological resilience, making them crucial elements of integrated mental health care strategies[^13][^81][^86]. Therefore, adopting a lifestyle that prioritizes healthy eating and regular physical activity is vital for reducing anxiety and enhancing mental health among adults[^54][^10][^87].

## <a id="section-18"></a>18. Food Additives and Anxiety: What Research Tells Us

The relationship between food additives and anxiety has gained significant attention in recent years, as evidence suggests that these substances can impact mental health. A particular focus has been on dietary emulsifiers, such as polysorbate 80 and carboxymethylcellulose, which are common in processed foods. Research involving mice has shown that these emulsifiers can alter gut microbiota composition and lead to low-grade intestinal inflammation. This inflammation may extend to influence brain function, as studies have observed changes in anxiety-related behaviors and social interactions in mice. Notably, sex-dependent responses were found, with male mice exhibiting more anxiety-like behaviors, while female mice showed lower levels of social engagement[^88].

In addition to emulsifiers, the consumption of fried foods has been linked to greater prevalence of anxiety and depression. Specifically, a study identified acrylamide—a compound formed during frying—as a potential contributor to these mental health issues. Experiments conducted on zebrafish demonstrated that acrylamide could lead to decreased exploration behaviors and sociability, akin to anxiety and depression symptoms in humans. This highlights a potential mechanism by which fried food consumption might affect mental wellness, although causation requires further exploration[^80].

The broader analysis of nutritional influences on mental health recognizes food additives as a possible factor affecting anxiety. However, comprehensive studies directly examining these connections remain limited. Existing meta-analyses emphasize the need for further investigation into the specific impact of food additives on mental health, advocating for more evidence-based research to inform potential dietary guidelines[^13].

Additionally, diets rich in additives, especially those high in sugars and processed foods, are believed to impair brain function and exacerbate mental health issues. The gut-brain axis, which describes the bidirectional relationship between the gastrointestinal system and the brain, plays a critical role here. An imbalanced diet can negatively influence the gut microbiome, crucially impacting mental well-being. Consequently, dietary strategies that avoid certain food additives and emphasize whole, fiber-rich foods may help manage anxiety symptoms by promoting a healthy gut environment[^36][^1].

The connection between food additives and mental health warrants attention, particularly in light of findings that specific additives, such as artificial colors, preservatives, and sweeteners, might contribute to behavioral changes and mood disorders in sensitive individuals. A diet minimizing processed foods and additives, while promoting whole food consumption, aligns with strategies to prevent and treat anxiety disorders, underscoring the potential for dietary modification in mental health management[^1].

## <a id="section-19"></a>19. Links Between High-Fat Diets and Anxiety Development

High-fat diets have been repeatedly associated with the development of anxiety, primarily through their impact on gut health and brain chemistry. Research indicates that these diets, especially rich in saturated fats, can disrupt gut microbiota, leading to altered neurotransmitter production and increased anxiety-like behaviors. In particular, studies conducted on animal models, such as rats and mice, have demonstrated that a high-fat diet results in reduced gut microbiome diversity and a rise in harmful bacteria, which correlates with anxiety and stress-related behaviors[^57][^4][^89].

The mechanism behind this involves the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. An unhealthy gut microbiome could impact the gut lining, possibly allowing harmful bacteria to enter circulation and trigger responses through the vagus nerve. This pathway plays a crucial role in linking dietary patterns to mental health, suggesting that dietary-induced changes in gut flora may affect serotonin production and subsequently contribute to heightened anxiety levels[^57][^46][^36].

In addition to microbiome alterations, high-fat diets may lead to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, which is known to exacerbate psychiatric conditions including anxiety and depression. Disrupted insulin metabolism can result in increased inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, further influencing mood and anxiety symptoms[^64][^90]. Furthermore, studies have found that components like acrylamide in fried foods, commonly consumed in high-fat diets, might contribute to mental health issues by affecting the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and downregulating essential genes involved in maintaining its permeability[^80].

Some research also sheds light on the ketogenic diet, characterized by high fat and low carbohydrate intake, showing potential mental health benefits. However, while there is evidence supporting its efficacy in reducing symptoms of certain mental health conditions, comprehensive studies to confirm its safety and impact, particularly regarding anxiety, are necessary[^63][^1]. Conversely, excess consumption of specific high-fat foods like soybean oil has been shown to promote the growth of harmful gut bacteria and may indirectly contribute to anxiety disorders[^52].

The relationship between high-fat diets and anxiety development highlights the relevance of dietary patterns in managing mental health. While not all fats are detrimental, and certain unsaturated fats may have protective qualities, moderation and dietary balance are crucial. Exploring interventions targeting gut health, alongside dietary modifications reducing saturated fat intake, could potentially alleviate anxiety and support overall mental well-being[^1][^46][^36].

## <a id="section-20"></a>20. Lifestyle Modifications to Support Mental Health

Lifestyle modifications can significantly support mental health, especially for individuals managing anxiety. Various studies suggest that integrating changes such as diet improvement, regular physical activity, mindfulness practices, and adequate sleep can collectively enhance mental well-being and reduce anxiety levels.

A key aspect of lifestyle modification is diet. Consuming a nutrient-rich diet that includes whole foods, fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can provide essential nutrients like magnesium, folate, omega-3 fatty acids, and B vitamins, which are crucial for brain health[^91][^10][^73][^3][^47]. On the other hand, diets high in ultra-processed foods can increase risks of anxiety and depression, emphasizing the importance of reducing processed food intake[^10][^29]. Moreover, studies have linked specific dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet to reduced symptoms of anxiety and stress, suggesting simple dietary modifications can have profound mental health benefits[^51].

Regular physical activity, such as moderate exercise, has immediate and long-term mood-elevating effects. It helps regulate stress hormones and improve neurotransmitter balance. Activities like yoga and mindfulness practices such as meditation have shown similar benefits, enhancing emotional regulation and reducing anxiety[^82][^54][^92]. Integrating physical activity into daily routines not only improves resilience to stressors but also promotes overall psychological health[^83].

Sleep is another critical component. Ensuring adequate and quality sleep by practicing good sleep hygiene and minimizing technology use before bedtime can significantly affect mood and stress levels. Regular sleep patterns support better emotional regulation and reduce symptoms related to anxiety[^93].

Engaging in mindfulness and meditation can be as effective as medication for managing anxiety, serving as accessible practices that complement traditional mental health treatments. These interventions help manage stress levels, improve mood, and promote overall emotional well-being by encouraging present-moment awareness and reducing negative thought patterns[^82].

Social support and community engagement should also be part of lifestyle modifications. Building a strong network through social activities can enhance mental resilience, reduce feelings of isolation, and provide emotional support during stressful times[^94].

Finally, addressing lifestyle habits such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption is crucial, given their detrimental effects on mental health. Reducing or eliminating these habits can significantly benefit mood and anxiety management[^91].

In summary, lifestyle modifications—including a balanced diet, physical activity, adequate sleep, mindfulness, and social support—play a critical role in supporting mental health and can particularly benefit individuals experiencing anxiety. Adopting these changes can foster a holistic approach to mental well-being, contributing to sustained improvements in quality of life[^91][^10][^82][^51].
