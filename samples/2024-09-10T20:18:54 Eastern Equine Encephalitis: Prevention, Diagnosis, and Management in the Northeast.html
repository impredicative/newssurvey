<h2 id="section-1">1. Understanding Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE)</h2>
<p>Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a severe mosquito-borne viral disease primarily affecting certain parts of the Americas, notably ranging from Central America to Canada. This virus can lead to substantial neurological illness, especially encephalitis—an inflammation and swelling of the brain—after being transmitted to humans via mosquito bites<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis?

Though the infection is relatively rare, it is notorious for its severity with a high mortality rate. Approximately 30% of individuals who develop encephalitis from EEE succumb to the disease, while many who survive suffer from lasting neurological impairments that may require extensive medical care<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis?

<p>The ecology of the EEE virus is peculiar as humans and horses are considered dead-end hosts, meaning they do not contribute to the transmission cycle since they do not produce sufficient levels of the virus to infect new mosquitoes. Birds, particularly certain species such as robins and starlings, play a central role as primary hosts. These birds maintain the virus's transmission cycle by infecting mosquitoes which then spread the virus to mammals<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis?

<h2 id="section-2">2. Epidemiology of EEE in the Northeast</h2>
<p>Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has recently become an increasingly significant public health concern in the Northeast United States, characterized by sporadic outbreaks with potentially severe consequences. Historically, the virus has demonstrated a pattern of fluctuating outbreak severity in this region, influenced by various ecological, environmental, and social factors. The largest documented outbreak in 50 years occurred in 2019, with 38 cases reported across several states, resulting in a noticeable number of fatalities and long-term disabilities among survivors<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-qa-virologist-discusses-deadly-eastern.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Q&A: Virologist discusses deadly eastern equine encephalitis virus, a familiar but formidable foe</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis?

<p>The epidemiology of EEE in the Northeast reveals that certain demographic groups, such as individuals under 15 and over 50, are at higher risk for severe outcomes. This is attributed to both the direct effects of the virus and the inflammatory responses it triggers in the brain<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-qa-virologist-discusses-deadly-eastern.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Q&A: Virologist discusses deadly eastern equine encephalitis virus, a familiar but formidable foe</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-6" class="citation-link"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-snakes-wild-harbor-deadly-mosquito-borne.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study finds snakes in the wild harbor deadly mosquito-borne EEEV virus through hibernation</a><sup>]</sup>.

<h2 id="section-3">3. Transmission and Mosquito Vectors</h2>
<p>Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, with the virus cycling among birds, mosquitoes, and occasionally mammals such as humans and horses. The main mosquito vector responsible for maintaining the EEE virus in nature is Culiseta melanura, which feeds primarily on birds and rarely bites humans<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis?

Infected birds, primarily passerine species like robins, blue jays, and thrushes, serve as the reservoir hosts, allowing the virus to persist in specific ecological niches<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis? Two mosquito researchers explain what's behind the latest outbreaks</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Transmission to humans occurs through bridge vector mosquitoes, which feed on both birds and mammals. These include various species of the Aedes, Coquillettidia, and Culex genera. Aedes species, in particular, are known to feed on a broad range of hosts, thus facilitating the spillover of the virus from bird to human populations<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis? Two mosquito researchers explain what's behind the latest outbreaks</a><sup>]</sup>. Humans, however, are dead-end hosts; they do not produce virus levels high enough to perpetuate the transmission cycle back to mosquitoes<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-qa-virologist-discusses-deadly-eastern.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Q&A: Virologist discusses deadly eastern equine encephalitis virus, a familiar but formidable foe</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Environmental conditions significantly impact mosquito populations and EEE transmission dynamics. Mosquitoes lay eggs in standing water, and species like Culiseta melanura thrive in wetland environments, such as hardwood swamps, which provide ideal conditions for the virus's mosquito vectors<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-6" class="citation-link"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-snakes-wild-harbor-deadly-mosquito-borne.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study finds snakes in the wild harbor deadly mosquito-borne EEEV virus through hibernation</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-12" class="citation-link"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-mosquitoes-fact-fiction.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Mosquitoes: Fact and fiction when it comes to bite prevention</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-climate-blame-england-eee-outbreak.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Is climate change to blame for New England's EEE outbreak?</a><sup>]</sup>. Factors such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity are crucial; warmer temperatures and increased rainfall enhance mosquito breeding conditions, prolonging the transmission season and raising EEE risk<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-8" class="citation-link"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-09-eee-mosquito-borne-virus.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is the EEE mosquito-borne virus?</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-climate-blame-england-eee-outbreak.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Is climate change to blame for New England's EEE outbreak?</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">4. Climate Change and EEE Incidence</h2>
<p>Climate change has been increasingly associated with the rise in the incidence of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in the Northeast United States, particularly due to its influence on the behavior and proliferation of mosquito vectors that transmit the virus. As global temperatures rise, the ecological balance that regulates mosquito populations is disrupted, thereby extending their active seasons and expanding their geographical range. This is particularly noticeable in warmer and wetter conditions, which create ideal breeding habitats for mosquitoes, potentially leading to higher populations and extended periods of virus transmission from birds, who are primary hosts, to humans through mosquito bites<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-climate-blame-england-eee-outbreak.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Is climate change to blame for New England's EEE outbreak?</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-8" class="citation-link"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-09-eee-mosquito-borne-virus.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is the EEE mosquito-borne virus?</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis?

<p>One of the key factors linked to climate change is the increase in "mosquito days," characterized by warm and humid conditions favorable for mosquito activities. Over the past four decades, reports have highlighted a significant rise in these days, correlating with a growing number of EEE cases. This extension of conducive conditions for mosquito activity results from altered weather patterns, including increased rainfall and humidity, which are both direct effects of climate change. Additionally, longer summers have been recorded, which prolong the timeframe for potential transmission events<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-9" class="citation-link"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-patient-dies-rare-mosquito-borne.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">US patient dies from rare mosquito-borne disease</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-8" class="citation-link"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-09-eee-mosquito-borne-virus.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is the EEE mosquito-borne virus?</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In the Northeast, key climatic shifts such as a 3.8-degree increase in average annual temperatures since 1895 and greater annual precipitation, particularly in winter and spring, have facilitated conditions that may promote EEE outbreaks. These conditions have occasionally led to unprecedented case numbers and fatalities, suggesting a significant upward trend compared to the historical average<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-climate-blame-england-eee-outbreak.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Is climate change to blame for New England's EEE outbreak?</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis? Two mosquito researchers explain what's behind the latest outbreaks</a><sup>]</sup>. The changing climate has also influenced the habitats and migratory patterns of birds and mosquitoes, further complicating the transmission dynamics of the virus. This interface between ecological factors and climate change implies a northward shift of EEE cases, enhancing the threat of the disease in areas previously considered low risk<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-climate-blame-england-eee-outbreak.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Is climate change to blame for New England's EEE outbreak?</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis? Two mosquito researchers explain what's behind the latest outbreaks</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The potential northward migration and increase in virus activity underscore the importance of continuous monitoring and research to better understand climate-related trends and address public health challenges. The growing incidence of EEE, fueled by climate change, highlights the need for strategic preventive measures and public health responses to mitigate the risk of outbreaks<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-climate-blame-england-eee-outbreak.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Is climate change to blame for New England's EEE outbreak?</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-18" class="citation-link"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-09-michigan-deadly-mosquito-virus.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Michigan will spray in fight against deadly mosquito virus</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, while direct links between climate change and EEE incidence are complex due to the multifaceted nature of virus transmission and human case rarity, current evidence suggests a strong correlation.

<h2 id="section-6">6. Diagnosis of EEE</h2>
<p>Diagnosing Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) involves a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory testing due to the initial symptoms being nonspecific and similar to many other viral infections. These symptoms typically appear 3 to 10 days after infection and include fever, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, behavioral changes, and in severe cases, signs of encephalitis or meningitis such as neck stiffness and confusion<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-qa-virologist-discusses-deadly-eastern.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Q&A: Virologist discusses deadly eastern equine encephalitis virus, a familiar but formidable foe</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-8" class="citation-link"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-09-eee-mosquito-borne-virus.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is the EEE mosquito-borne virus?</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-poses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Eastern equine encephalitis virus poses emergent threat, say NIH officials</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-9" class="citation-link"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-patient-dies-rare-mosquito-borne.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">US patient dies from rare mosquito-borne disease</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>For a definitive diagnosis, health professionals rely on two key laboratory tests: serological tests and molecular testing. Serological tests are used to detect antibodies against the EEE virus in the patient's serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The presence of these antibodies helps confirm exposure to the virus, especially in the later stages of infection<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-poses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Eastern equine encephalitis virus poses emergent threat, say NIH officials</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis?

<h2 id="section-7">7. Treatment Options for EEE</h2>
<p>Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment approved for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The management of EEE primarily involves supportive care to address and alleviate the severe symptoms associated with the infection. This care includes hospitalization for individuals experiencing severe neurological manifestations such as encephalitis or meningitis, and can involve measures to maintain respiratory function, manage fever, control seizures, and ensure adequate hydration<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-poses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Eastern equine encephalitis virus poses emergent threat, say NIH officials</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-9" class="citation-link"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-patient-dies-rare-mosquito-borne.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">US patient dies from rare mosquito-borne disease</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>One promising area of research involves the development of antiviral compounds that can penetrate the brain and inhibit viral replication. A novel compound, BDGR-49, developed by researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, has shown efficacy in mice models. This compound offers protection against EEEV by disrupting the viral replication machinery, and has been well-tolerated in treated animals<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-23" class="citation-link"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-04-brain-penetrating-drug-candidate-effective-deadly.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Brain-penetrating drug candidate found to be effective against deadly encephalitis viruses</a><sup>]</sup>. The compound demonstrates significant brain penetration capacity, a critical characteristic since EEEV primarily affects the brain. The efficacy of BDGR-49, even when administered days after infection, indicates potential as an effective treatment for EEE, pending further preclinical and clinical evaluations<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-23" class="citation-link"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-04-brain-penetrating-drug-candidate-effective-deadly.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Brain-penetrating drug candidate found to be effective against deadly encephalitis viruses</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>A different approach investigates the use of decoy receptors to prevent the virus from entering human neurons. Research has demonstrated that EEEV uses cell receptors such as the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) to invade brain cells. Scientists have developed a decoy molecule mimicking this receptor, providing significant virus-neutralizing effects in laboratory settings<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-19" class="citation-link"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-01-reveals-clues-eastern-equine-encephalitis.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study reveals clues to how Eastern equine encephalitis virus invades brain cells</a><sup>]</sup>. This advancement presents potential future therapeutic options that could form the basis of new treatment strategies.</p>
<p>Intravenous immunoglobulins have been used in some cases, though evidence for their effectiveness in reducing mortality is not strong. The rapid progression of EEE poses a significant challenge for timely therapeutic intervention, where symptoms can quickly escalate from mild to severe<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-qa-virologist-discusses-deadly-eastern.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Q&A: Virologist discusses deadly eastern equine encephalitis virus, a familiar but formidable foe</a><sup>]</sup>. Therefore, early recognition and rapid response are critical.</p>
<p>Immune evasion strategies by EEEV have also been identified, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. For example, the virus's ability to manipulate host microRNA to evade immune detection could be disrupted. This insight may guide the development of treatments using microRNA blockers or synbio-inspired approaches that make use of mutant strains unable to evade immunity<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-20" class="citation-link"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-immune-mechanism-treatments-deadly-mosquito-borne.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Immune avoidance mechanism could lead to treatments for deadly mosquito-borne viruses</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Despite these promising research directions, no treatments have yet emerged into clinical practice as a validated option for EEE. This underscores the importance of continued investment in research to develop new antiviral drugs and explore mechanisms that may prevent or reverse EEEV-induced damage. Until specialized treatments are available, supportive care remains the cornerstone of clinical management for EEE<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-qa-virologist-discusses-deadly-eastern.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Q&A: Virologist discusses deadly eastern equine encephalitis virus, a familiar but formidable foe</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-17" class="citation-link"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-08-safe-eastern-equine-encephalitis.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">How to stay safe from eastern equine encephalitis</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-9" class="citation-link"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-patient-dies-rare-mosquito-borne.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">US patient dies from rare mosquito-borne disease</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-11">11. Potential Vaccine Developments for EEE</h2>
<p>The development of a vaccine for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) remains a challenging but critical goal. Historically, no licensed vaccine exists for humans, though a veterinary vaccine is available for horses<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis? Two mosquito researchers explain what's behind the latest outbreaks</a><sup>]</sup>. The sporadic and unpredictable nature of EEE outbreaks complicates vaccine development and testing. This makes it difficult to identify and prioritize target populations for vaccination, particularly since human cases are rare and outbreaks occur unpredictably across locations<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-poses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Eastern equine encephalitis virus poses emergent threat, say NIH officials</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-8" class="citation-link"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-09-eee-mosquito-borne-virus.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is the EEE mosquito-borne virus?</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Recent advances in research have opened promising pathways for vaccine development. For instance, research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has led to the development of a trivalent vaccine candidate targeting EEEV, along with western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. This vaccine, known as WEVEE, consists of virus-like particles designed to elicit an immune response without causing infection. Initial results from a Phase 1 clinical trial showed that the vaccine was safe and induced durable immune responses, particularly at a 30-microgram dose level with an alum adjuvant to enhance the immune response<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-28" class="citation-link"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-05-vaccine-rare-deadly-mosquito-borne-viruses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Vaccine for rare but deadly mosquito-borne viruses shows promise in clinical trial</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, insights into the mechanisms of EEEV infection have spurred novel approaches. The discovery of EEEV's use of the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and potential decoy strategies to inhibit the virus provide a pathway for therapeutic and vaccine development. This research demonstrated that a decoy receptor could effectively neutralize the virus in laboratory settings, such as in mice models, by preventing EEEV from binding to actual neural receptors<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-19" class="citation-link"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-01-reveals-clues-eastern-equine-encephalitis.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study reveals clues to how Eastern equine encephalitis virus invades brain cells</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-qa-virologist-discusses-deadly-eastern.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Q&A: Virologist discusses deadly eastern equine encephalitis virus, a familiar but formidable foe</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Despite these promising developments, the path to licensure and widespread deployment of a human vaccine faces hurdles. Key among these is the difficulty of conducting large-scale trials due to the low incidence of EEE cases, which affects the ability to establish efficacy and safety in a statistically significant population<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-poses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Eastern equine encephalitis virus poses emergent threat, say NIH officials</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-8" class="citation-link"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-09-eee-mosquito-borne-virus.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is the EEE mosquito-borne virus?</a><sup>]</sup>. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to develop vaccines that target mosquito saliva, potentially conferring protection against multiple mosquito-borne diseases, including EEE, though such vaccines are still in their infancy<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-poses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Eastern equine encephalitis virus poses emergent threat, say NIH officials</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>As climate change potentially increases the incidence of vector-borne diseases like EEE, the imperative for a viable vaccine becomes even more pronounced. Ongoing research continues to be essential in the quest to develop efficacious vaccines and treatments, highlighting the necessity for a coordinated national strategy to address these emerging health threats<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-9" class="citation-link"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-patient-dies-rare-mosquito-borne.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">US patient dies from rare mosquito-borne disease</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In summary, while there has been progress in understanding the virology and immunology of EEEV, leading to promising vaccine candidates, significant challenges remain. Continued research, investment, and multi-disciplinary collaboration are critical to overcoming the barriers to developing a licensed EEE vaccine for human use.</p>

<h2 id="section-12">12. Comparison with Other Mosquito-borne Diseases</h2>
<p>Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is one of several mosquito-borne diseases, each offering a unique set of challenges in terms of transmission, symptoms, and public health impact. EEE is particularly noteworthy for its high mortality rate and potential for severe neurological complications, a characteristic that sets it apart from other mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus, Zika, and chikungunya<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-26" class="citation-link"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eee-west-nile-malaria-difference.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">EEE, West Nile, malaria: Know the difference between these mosquito-borne diseases</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis?

<p>The transmission dynamics for these diseases also differ. EEE, like West Nile virus, involves birds in its transmission cycle, utilizing specific bird species as primary hosts. EEE relies heavily on passerines, whereas West Nile virus involves a broader range of bird species<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis?

<p>EEE's higher severity and mortality rate demand an urgent, albeit challenging, approach to vaccine development, similar to efforts for West Nile and Zika viruses. Despite being rare, EEE's lethality has spurred initiatives for vaccine research, which are still compounded by the difficulty of targeting sporadic outbreaks<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-poses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Eastern equine encephalitis virus poses emergent threat, say NIH officials</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-28" class="citation-link"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-05-vaccine-rare-deadly-mosquito-borne-viruses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Vaccine for rare but deadly mosquito-borne viruses shows promise in clinical trial</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Among these diseases, dengue fever exhibits a global prevalence unmatched by EEE, affecting up to half the world’s population with severe symptoms, whereas malaria, transmitted by mosquitoes but caused by a parasite, poses substantial mortality rates especially in tropical regions<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-26" class="citation-link"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eee-west-nile-malaria-difference.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">EEE, West Nile, malaria: Know the difference between these mosquito-borne diseases</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The varying degrees of severity, lethality, and geographical distribution among mosquito-borne diseases underscore the necessity for targeted public health strategies and continuous research efforts.

<h2 id="section-13">13. Role of Wildlife in EEE Virus Transmission</h2>
<p>Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) relies heavily on a diverse array of wildlife to maintain its transmission cycle, with birds playing a particularly critical role. Passerines, such as robins, starlings, thrushes, and blue jays, serve as primary hosts by harboring the virus at sufficient levels to infect mosquitoes, specifically Culiseta melanura, which themselves rarely bite humans<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-latest.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">What is eastern equine encephalitis?

<p>Beyond avian involvement, other wildlife species also contribute to the EEEV transmission ecology. Recent findings highlight that Culex erraticus, a mosquito species prevalent in the southeastern United States, amplifies the virus in wading birds such as herons. This amplifying capacity allows these mosquitoes to act as bridge vectors, transmitting the virus to mammals like horses and humans, thus underscoring the relevance of avian populations and the mosquitoes that feed on them in the broader transmission network<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-mosquito-species-key-transmitting-eee.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Mosquito species may be key to transmitting EEE virus in southeast US</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, snakes, including cottonmouths, have been identified as potential reservoirs for the virus. They can sustain EEEV through hibernation, releasing it during waking periods in the spring when mosquitoes begin to feed, thereby reinitiating the transmission cycle with birds and then onto other animals such as horses and humans<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-6" class="citation-link"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-snakes-wild-harbor-deadly-mosquito-borne.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study finds snakes in the wild harbor deadly mosquito-borne EEEV virus through hibernation</a><sup>]</sup>. This previously unconsidered mechanism extends the overwintering capability of the virus beyond traditional avian hosts<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-6" class="citation-link"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-snakes-wild-harbor-deadly-mosquito-borne.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Study finds snakes in the wild harbor deadly mosquito-borne EEEV virus through hibernation</a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Wildlife surveillance, primarily among birds, is essential for early detection and prevention of human risk from EEEV. Monitoring these populations helps gauge potential outbreaks and guide public health interventions. For example, elevated levels of virus in bird populations can signal an impending risk, enabling timely public health responses<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-poses.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Eastern equine encephalitis virus poses emergent threat, say NIH officials</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-climate-blame-england-eee-outbreak.html" class="citation-tooltip" target="_blank">Is climate change to blame for New England's EEE outbreak?</a><sup>]</sup>.
