<h2 id="section-2">2. Current Pharmacological Treatments for GERD</h2>
<p>Current pharmacological treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) primarily include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2 blockers), and antacids. PPIs, such as omeprazole and esomeprazole, are the cornerstone of GERD pharmacotherapy, as they effectively reduce stomach acid production, providing symptom relief for many patients<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-27" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-05-modern-treatments-gerd-effective-long-term.html" target="_blank">Modern treatments for GERD effective at achieving long-term remission for most patients</a>'><sup>27</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-28" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-12-acid-reflux-affects-adults-weekly.html" target="_blank">Acid reflux affects nearly a third of US adults weekly</a>'><sup>28</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-5" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-incision-free-surgery-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">New incision-free surgery helps tame chronic acid reflux</a>'><sup>5</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Despite their efficacy, recent studies have highlighted concerns regarding the long-term use of PPIs, including risks of kidney disease, nutrient deficiencies, and potential associations with increased cancer and dementia risks<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-21" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-01-dots-heartburn-drugs-kidney.html" target="_blank">Connecting the dots between heartburn drugs and kidney damage</a>'><sup>21</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-29" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-long-term-acid-reflux-drugs-linked.html" target="_blank">Long-term use of certain acid reflux drugs linked to higher risk of dementia</a>'><sup>29</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-30" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-02-common-acid-reflux-medications-linked.html" target="_blank">Common acid reflux medications linked to increased kidney disease risk</a>'><sup>30</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>H2 blockers, such as famotidine and ranitidine, offer an alternative for patients who experience side effects from or are at risk from prolonged PPI use. They also reduce stomach acid production but may be less effective than PPIs in controlling severe symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-expert-reflux-disease-isnt-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert explains why reflux disease isn&#x27;t &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-31" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-07-heartburn-drugs-allergy-woes.html" target="_blank">Heartburn drugs might bring allergy woes</a>'><sup>31</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-gerd-heartburn.html" target="_blank">GERD is not &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>2</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Concerns about long-term H2 blocker use are less pronounced compared to PPIs, but recent recalls of ranitidine due to potential carcinogen contamination have limited its availability<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-32" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-01-heartburn-meds-recalled-due-carcinogen.html" target="_blank">Two more heartburn meds recalled due to possible carcinogen</a>'><sup>32</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Emerging treatments aim to target GERD with innovative mechanisms. The potassium-competitive acid blocker Voquezna (vonoprazan) has shown promising results in clinical trials, offering an alternative acid suppression strategy with potential to rival traditional PPIs<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-23" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-11-fda-voquezna-erosive-esophagitis-gerd.html" target="_blank">FDA approves Voquezna for erosive esophagitis, GERD</a>'><sup>23</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Additionally, bile acid-binding agents like IW-3718 are being studied for their ability to address symptoms in patients for whom PPIs are insufficient, by targeting bile reflux, which is another contributor to GERD symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-33" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-02-potential-heartburn-drug-vumc.html" target="_blank">Potential new heartburn drug studied at VUMC</a>'><sup>33</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Beyond pharmacological interventions, alternative treatments are being explored for those with PPI-resistant GERD, including surgical options such as fundoplication and endoscopic procedures like transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF)<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-34" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-surgery-tough-to-treat-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Surgery helps tough-to-treat acid reflux</a>'><sup>34</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-35" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-01-transoral-fundoplication-effective-treatment-patients.html" target="_blank">Transoral fundoplication is an effective treatment for patients with GERD</a>'><sup>35</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Devices such as the LINX Reflux Management System and electrical stimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter have also been developed to enhance the closure of the esophageal sphincter, a primary mechanical contributor to reflux, and have shown efficacy in reducing the need for ongoing medication<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-36" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-effectiveness-magnetic-device-treatment-reflux.html" target="_blank">Study shows effectiveness of magnetic device for treatment of reflux disease</a>'><sup>36</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-37" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-electrical-esophagus-treatment-unresolved-reflux.html" target="_blank">Electrical stimulation of the esophagus promising treatment for unresolved reflux symptoms</a>'><sup>37</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Several studies emphasize the importance of personalizing treatment plans based on individual metabolism and response to medications.

<h2 id="section-3">3. Risks Associated with Long-Term Use of Acid Reflux Medications</h2>
<p>Long-term use of acid reflux medications, notably proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 blockers, has been associated with several potential risks that warrant careful consideration. One of the most significant concerns is the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure. Multiple studies underscore a notable association between prolonged PPI use and an increased risk of kidney-related issues. For example, individuals using PPIs faced increased risks of developing CKD and even kidney failure compared to those on H2 blockers, who reported fewer kidney-related complications<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-40" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-03-ties-common-heartburn-medications-kidney.html" target="_blank">Research ties common heartburn medications to kidney disease and failure</a>'><sup>40</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-22" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-06-heartburn-drugs-tied-fatal.html" target="_blank">Heartburn drugs again tied to fatal risks</a>'><sup>22</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-42" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-commonly-reflux-ulcer-medication-kidney.html" target="_blank">Commonly used reflux and ulcer medication may cause serious kidney damage</a>'><sup>42</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-43" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-heartburn-medicine-kidney-disease.html" target="_blank">Heartburn medicine can increase risk of kidney disease</a>'><sup>43</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, long-term PPI usage has been linked with an increased propensity for gastrointestinal infections such as Clostridium difficile and Campylobacter, attributed to the suppression of stomach acid that typically helps regulate gut bacteria<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-44" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-01-heartburn-drugs-stomach-infections.html" target="_blank">Heartburn drugs may raise risk of stomach infections: study</a>'><sup>44</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-45" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-popular-heartburn-drugs-odds-stomach.html" target="_blank">Popular heartburn drugs may up odds of stomach bug</a>'><sup>45</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.

<p>There is an emerging body of evidence pointing to potential cognitive risks associated with prolonged PPI use. Studies have tied extended PPI consumption to increased risks of dementia<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-29" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-long-term-acid-reflux-drugs-linked.html" target="_blank">Long-term use of certain acid reflux drugs linked to higher risk of dementia</a>'><sup>29</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Although these findings are often based on observational studies that do not establish causality, they underscore the need for a cautious approach in the long-term use of PPIs, particularly among older populations<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-29" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-long-term-acid-reflux-drugs-linked.html" target="_blank">Long-term use of certain acid reflux drugs linked to higher risk of dementia</a>'><sup>29</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-49" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-01-acid-reflux-drugs-negative-side.html" target="_blank">Acid reflux drugs may have negative side effects for breast cancer survivors</a>'><sup>49</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Another area of concern is the potential for cardiovascular-related risks. Prolonged PPI usage has been observed to correlate with heightened mortality from cardiovascular events<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-22" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-06-heartburn-drugs-tied-fatal.html" target="_blank">Heartburn drugs again tied to fatal risks</a>'><sup>22</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-50" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-07-popular-heartburn-drugs-linked-higher.html" target="_blank">Popular heartburn drugs linked to higher death risk</a>'><sup>50</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.

<h2 id="section-4">4. Alternative Surgical and Non-Surgical Treatments for GERD</h2>
<p>There are several alternative surgical and non-surgical treatments available for managing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), particularly for patients who do not achieve sufficient relief from standard medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers. These options vary in approach and invasiveness, allowing individuals to choose a treatment that best suits their condition and lifestyle preferences.</p>
<p>Surgical treatments such as fundoplication remain a mainstay for severe GERD. This procedure involves wrapping the top of the stomach around the esophagus to create a valve mechanism, thus preventing acid reflux. While effective, it may not be suitable for everyone due to potential side effects like difficulty belching or vomiting<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-34" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-surgery-tough-to-treat-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Surgery helps tough-to-treat acid reflux</a>'><sup>34</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-55" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-03-low-risk-surgery-chronic-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Could a low-risk surgery help your chronic heartburn?</a>'><sup>55</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-22" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-06-heartburn-drugs-tied-fatal.html" target="_blank">Heartburn drugs again tied to fatal risks</a>'><sup>22</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. For patients seeking less invasive surgical options, laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery, which has been linked to fewer complications, may be a viable choice<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-56" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-01-laparoscopic-anti-reflux-gerd-linked-postoperative.html" target="_blank">Laparoscopic anti-reflux operation for GERD linked to fewer postoperative complications</a>'><sup>56</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Advancements in minimally invasive procedures offer alternatives like the LINX Reflux Management System. This device consists of magnetic beads that are implanted laparoscopically to augment the lower esophageal sphincter, allowing it to open for food passage and close to prevent reflux. Clinical studies have demonstrated its effectiveness and safety, leading to significant reductions in medication use for many patients<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-36" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-effectiveness-magnetic-device-treatment-reflux.html" target="_blank">Study shows effectiveness of magnetic device for treatment of reflux disease</a>'><sup>36</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-bracelet-like-device-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Bracelet-like device controls chronic acid reflux, study finds</a>'><sup>4</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Another innovative approach is transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF), which reshapes the anti-reflux valve endoscopically, preventing stomach contents from entering the esophagus. TIF offers an incisionless solution with a promising safety profile, reducing symptoms in patients refractory to medication<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-57" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-05-american-foregut-society-white-paper.html" target="_blank">American Foregut Society white paper provides best practices for use of newer, less invasive GERD treatments</a>'><sup>57</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-35" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-01-transoral-fundoplication-effective-treatment-patients.html" target="_blank">Transoral fundoplication is an effective treatment for patients with GERD</a>'><sup>35</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Endoscopic therapies like anti-reflux mucosectomy (ARMS) and anti-reflux mucosal ablation (ARMA) are also gaining traction. These treatments involve modifying the esophageal lining to reduce reflux episodes, with studies indicating long-term effectiveness and significant symptom improvement in patients refractory to PPIs<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-58" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-06-anti-reflux-mucosectomy-effective-gerd-term.html" target="_blank">Anti-reflux mucosectomy effective for GERD in long term</a>'><sup>58</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-59" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-gerd-questionnaire-scores-antireflux-mucosectomy.html" target="_blank">Improved GERD questionnaire scores seen with antireflux mucosectomy</a>'><sup>59</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-60" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-antireflux-mucosectomy-mucosal-ablation-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Antireflux mucosectomy, mucosal ablation compared for gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>'><sup>60</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>For those not pursuing surgical interventions, electrical stimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter presents a non-surgical approach to strengthen the sphincter and reduce reflux events. This technique has shown success in lowering the need for medication while enhancing quality of life<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-37" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-electrical-esophagus-treatment-unresolved-reflux.html" target="_blank">Electrical stimulation of the esophagus promising treatment for unresolved reflux symptoms</a>'><sup>37</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the range of available treatments allows for personalized management of GERD, taking into account the severity of symptoms, patient preferences, and previous treatment responses. The decision between surgical and non-surgical alternatives should be made in collaboration with healthcare providers, ensuring that each patient receives the most suitable and effective management strategy for their GERD symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">5. Lifestyle Modifications for Managing GERD</h2>
<p>Adopting lifestyle modifications can significantly help manage gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms, often reducing the need for medication. Research indicates that maintaining a normal weight is crucial as it can alleviate pressure on the stomach and reduce reflux incidents. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is recommended for at least 30 minutes daily as it improves digestive motility and enhances acid clearance, thereby mitigating heartburn symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-61" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-05-weight-ease-chronic-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Losing weight may ease chronic heartburn</a>'><sup>61</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Dietary adjustments play a critical role and can vary widely since GERD triggers are highly individualized.

<h2 id="section-6">6. The Role of the Mediterranean-Style Diet in GERD</h2>
<p>The Mediterranean-style diet, characterized by its emphasis on plant-based foods, minimal consumption of dairy and meats, and the inclusion of whole foods, may play a significant role in managing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. Research indicates that adopting this dietary pattern can substantially reduce symptoms of acid reflux. A comparative study found that participants who followed a diet consisting largely of fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts, coupled with alkaline water, experienced a 62.6% reduction in their Reflux Symptom Index (RSI). This reduction was notably greater than the 54.1% observed in patients using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), highlighting the potential effectiveness of this dietary approach as a non-pharmacological intervention for GERD<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-66" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-09-mediterranean-style-diet-reflux-medications.html" target="_blank">Mediterranean-style diet may eliminate need for reflux medications</a>'><sup>66</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The success of the Mediterranean-style diet in managing GERD may be attributed to several factors. The diet is low in saturated fats and high in fiber, which can improve gastrointestinal health and function. Additionally, by promoting weight loss and reducing high blood pressure and cholesterol, the diet addresses comorbidities often associated with GERD, contributing to symptom relief and overall health benefits<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-66" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-09-mediterranean-style-diet-reflux-medications.html" target="_blank">Mediterranean-style diet may eliminate need for reflux medications</a>'><sup>66</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a broader study on diet and lifestyle conducted through the Nurses&#x27; Health Study emphasized that dietary practices, when combined with other lifestyle adjustments such as regular physical activity and weight management, can significantly mitigate GERD symptoms. This study underlined the importance of maintaining a normal weight, engaging in moderate-to-vigorous exercise, and following a &#x27;prudent&#x27; diet, akin to Mediterranean-style eating, to alleviate heartburn and promote digestive health. These findings suggest the complementary role of physical fitness in enhancing digestive tract motility, which helps clear stomach acid, potentially providing further symptom relief<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, the emerging evidence supports the Mediterranean-style diet as a viable dietary strategy for reducing acid reflux symptoms and managing GERD, offering a promising alternative or supplement to traditional pharmacological treatments. This dietary approach not only addresses the primary symptoms of GERD but also contributes to improved long-term health outcomes by fostering weight loss and reducing the risk of chronic diseases associated with an unhealthy dietâŸ¦1, 2âŸ§.</p>

<h2 id="section-7">7. Impact of Abdominal Fat on GERD Symptoms</h2>
<p>Abdominal fat, particularly visceral fat, is a significant factor in exacerbating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. Research indicates that excess abdominal fat increases the pressure on the stomach, which can impact the functionality of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-61" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-05-weight-ease-chronic-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Losing weight may ease chronic heartburn</a>'><sup>61</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-53" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-12-holiday-heartburn-gastroenterologist.html" target="_blank">Tips on how to avoid holiday heartburn from a gastroenterologist</a>'><sup>53</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-6" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-09-device-gastroesophageal-reflux-stapling-stomach.html" target="_blank">Device treats gastroesophageal reflux by stapling stomach to esophagus through mouth</a>'><sup>6</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. This increased pressure can lead to the LES not closing properly, permitting stomach contents to reflux into the esophagus and thus escalating GERD symptoms. Studies have shown that individuals with increased abdominal fat are more likely to experience severe reflux symptoms due to this mechanistic issue<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-66" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-09-mediterranean-style-diet-reflux-medications.html" target="_blank">Mediterranean-style diet may eliminate need for reflux medications</a>'><sup>66</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Weight management, notably the reduction of visceral fat, appears to be an effective non-pharmacological strategy for alleviating GERD symptoms. Weight loss has been associated with significant improvements in GERD symptoms regardless of the initial body weight. Research involving over 200 patients revealed that those who lost weight over one year showed a substantial decline in heartburn symptoms, highlighting that even a minor gain in weight could potentially lead to a resurgence in symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-61" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-05-weight-ease-chronic-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Losing weight may ease chronic heartburn</a>'><sup>61</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. A study from the Nurses&#x27; Health Study indicated that maintaining a normal weight can reduce GERD symptoms by approximately 37% when combined with regular physical activity and a balanced diet<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Physical activity, advocating for about five hours per week, is not only beneficial for weight management but also for enhancing the digestive tract&#x27;s motility, helping to mitigate GERD symptoms by facilitating the more effective clearing of stomach acid from the esophagus<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-61" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-05-weight-ease-chronic-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Losing weight may ease chronic heartburn</a>'><sup>61</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Furthermore, lifestyle changes that include a regular eating and sleeping schedule can help alleviate GERD symptoms, underscoring the importance of comprehensive weight management<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-53" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-12-holiday-heartburn-gastroenterologist.html" target="_blank">Tips on how to avoid holiday heartburn from a gastroenterologist</a>'><sup>53</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The role of diet in managing abdominal fat and GERD symptoms is also notable. A Mediterranean-style diet, which encourages weight loss and reduction of visceral fat, has been shown to improve reflux symptoms and overall gastrointestinal health<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-66" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-09-mediterranean-style-diet-reflux-medications.html" target="_blank">Mediterranean-style diet may eliminate need for reflux medications</a>'><sup>66</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Such a diet not only aids in weight management but also contributes to improved general health markers, including blood pressure and cholesterol levels<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-66" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-09-mediterranean-style-diet-reflux-medications.html" target="_blank">Mediterranean-style diet may eliminate need for reflux medications</a>'><sup>66</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. By addressing dietary habits, individuals can potentially benefit from a reduction in GERD symptoms linked to abdominal fat.</p>
<p>Overall, managing abdominal fat through weight loss, increased physical activity, and dietary changes is evidently a beneficial approach to alleviating GERD symptoms. While further research is required to explore the extensive implications of these interventions, current evidence strongly supports their inclusion as part of comprehensive GERD management strategies.</p>

<h2 id="section-8">8. Non-Pharmacological Interventions: Myofascial Therapies and Diaphragmatic Breathing</h2>
<p>Myofascial therapies and diaphragmatic breathing are promising non-pharmacological interventions for managing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Myofascial therapy, a technique focused on releasing tension and improving flexibility in the connective tissues or fascia, has been demonstrated to alleviate reflux symptoms by specifically targeting the diaphragm. In a clinical trial conducted by researchers at Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera in Spain, 30 patients with GERD received manual therapy specifically geared towards relaxing the diaphragm&#x27;s fascia. The results were noteworthy, showing a reduction in symptom frequency and severity, ultimately leading to an enhanced quality of life and a decreased need for medication. This suggests that myofascial release could be a viable alternative to traditional pharmacological treatments, potentially minimizing the long-term side effects associated with them<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-24" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-05-myofascial-therapies-gastroesophageal-reflux.html" target="_blank">Myofascial therapies help treat gastroesophageal reflux</a>'><sup>24</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Diaphragmatic breathing exercises also play a critical role in the non-pharmacological management of GERD. These exercises involve deep, abdominal breathing which helps in reducing intra-abdominal pressure and improving esophageal function. A study at Singapore General Hospital observed the effects of diaphragmatic breathing on GERD symptoms, particularly belching. Participants who practiced diaphragmatic breathing reported a significant reduction in belching frequency and overall GERD symptoms. The study concluded that 60% of participants experienced a more than 50% decrease in belching scores compared to the control group. The improvements persisted for up to four months post-treatment, illustrating that diaphragmatic breathing can complement pharmacological measures to manage GERD symptoms more effectively<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-64" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-03-diaphragmatic-tied-belching-gerd.html" target="_blank">Diaphragmatic breathing tied to less belching in GERD</a>'><sup>64</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>These approaches align with insights from broader patient/physician interactions in integrated health care settings. A study highlighted the benefits of comprehensive visits where non-pharmacological methods, such as myofascial therapy and diaphragmatic breathing, are discussed, leading to greater symptom relief as compared to standard medical consultations. This points to the importance of including these therapies as part of a wider GERD management strategy<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-67" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-09-aspects-patientphysician-interaction-alleviate-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Aspects of patient/physician interaction may help alleviate heartburn symptoms</a>'><sup>67</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise, have been associated with a reduction in GERD symptoms. Exercise can enhance digestive motility and aid in the clearance of stomach acid, which may synergize with myofascial and breathing therapies to provide holistic relief for GERD patients. Incorporating these techniques into daily practice may lead to substantial improvements in GERD symptoms by leveraging the natural functioning of the diaphragm and surrounding musculature<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-9">9. Relationship Between GERD and Anxiety or Depression</h2>
<p>There is a well-documented relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression. Numerous studies have shown that anxiety and depression can significantly affect the prevalence and severity of GERD symptoms. For instance, a study involving 518 individuals with GERD, assessed through 24-hour pH monitoring and psychological evaluations, revealed a notable correlation between the severity of anxiety and depression and the frequency of GERD symptoms. Mild anxiety was shown to increase the odds of developing GERD, and the likelihood was even higher for those with moderate to severe anxiety. Likewise, moderate-to-severe depression was linked to an increased probability of GERD occurrence<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-68" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-anxiety-depression-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease.html" target="_blank">Anxiety, depression associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>'><sup>68</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Patients with GERD who do not respond well to traditional pharmacological treatments often exhibit heightened sensitivity to their symptoms, sometimes due to psychological factors. These patients may perceive their reflux symptoms more intensely than what is physiologically present. In such cases, addressing the psychological aspect is crucial. Studies have found that low-dose antidepressants and various non-pharmacological therapies, such as behavioral interventions and relaxation techniques, could provide symptom relief. For example, esophageal-directed hypnotherapy has been reported to significantly improve GERD symptoms, reduce visceral anxiety, and enhance quality of life for those experiencing functional heartburn<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-69" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-invasive-procedures-reserved-sub-group-acid.html" target="_blank">Invasive procedures should be reserved for a sub-group of acid reflux patients, study says</a>'><sup>69</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The physiological underpinnings connecting anxiety and stress with GERD symptoms often involve the brain-gut axis. Stress and anxiety can increase visceral hypersensitivity, making the gastrointestinal tract more reactive to minimal stimuli, which can lead to symptoms like cramping and bloating even when actual reflux is not significantly present. Managing these psychological factors through interventions like mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, and hypnotherapy can lead to an alleviation of GERD symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-63" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-12-expert-holiday-feasting-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert tips for holiday feasting without the heartburn</a>'><sup>63</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, physical activity and dietary changes can also play a role in the interplay between GERD and psychological factors. Regular exercise is thought to enhance gastrointestinal motility, which can help reduce reflux symptoms and subsequently decrease anxiety and depression related to GERD discomfort. In the Nurses&#x27; Health Study, lifestyle interventions, including physical activity, were associated with a significant decrease in GERD symptoms and demonstrated how improving physical health metrics can positively affect mental well-being<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, the relationship between GERD and psychological conditions is complex and bidirectional, meaning that each can influence the other. Healthcare providers should take this into consideration, employing a holistic treatment approach that addresses both the physiological and psychological needs of the patient to effectively manage GERD<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-68" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-anxiety-depression-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease.html" target="_blank">Anxiety, depression associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>'><sup>68</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-69" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-invasive-procedures-reserved-sub-group-acid.html" target="_blank">Invasive procedures should be reserved for a sub-group of acid reflux patients, study says</a>'><sup>69</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-63" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-12-expert-holiday-feasting-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert tips for holiday feasting without the heartburn</a>'><sup>63</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-10">10. Novel and Emerging Treatments for GERD</h2>
<p>The exploration of novel and emerging treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has seen significant advancements recently, providing alternative solutions for patients who do not respond adequately to traditional therapies. Clinicians often seek new strategies to achieve better symptom control and to address the underlying causes of GERD.</p>
<p>One such emerging treatment is the LINX Reflux Management System, a device consisting of a ring of magnetic beads that is surgically implanted around the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This device addresses the fundamental mechanical failure of the LES by reinforcing its closure, preventing acid reflux while allowing food passage during swallowing. Clinical trials have shown substantial improvements in patient outcomes, with a significant reduction in GERD symptoms and decreased reliance on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-bracelet-like-device-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Bracelet-like device controls chronic acid reflux, study finds</a>'><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-36" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-effectiveness-magnetic-device-treatment-reflux.html" target="_blank">Study shows effectiveness of magnetic device for treatment of reflux disease</a>'><sup>36</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-54" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-04-implanted-bracelet-chronic-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Implanted &#x27;bracelet&#x27; helps treat chronic heartburn (Update 2)</a>'><sup>54</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-70" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-09-magnets-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Magnets help cure chronic acid reflux</a>'><sup>70</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-71" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-04-case-fda-approval-magnetic-device-heartburn.html" target="_blank">First US case since FDA-approval, new magnetic device for heartburn</a>'><sup>71</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, electrical stimulation of the LES is being explored as an effective long-term treatment option for GERD. Devices delivering low-energy electrical pulses have shown promising results, with many patients experiencing normalization or significant reductions in GERD symptoms and medication use. While initial trials have yielded encouraging data, further research is necessary to solidify its place within GERD treatment paradigms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-37" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-electrical-esophagus-treatment-unresolved-reflux.html" target="_blank">Electrical stimulation of the esophagus promising treatment for unresolved reflux symptoms</a>'><sup>37</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF) and its variations, such as Concomitant TIF (cTIF), represent another emerging approach, focusing on reconstructing the anti-reflux valve without external incisions. These techniques offer an alternative for patients who remain symptomatic despite conventional medical management and have shown a reduction in side effects commonly associated with traditional surgical options<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-5" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-incision-free-surgery-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">New incision-free surgery helps tame chronic acid reflux</a>'><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-57" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-05-american-foregut-society-white-paper.html" target="_blank">American Foregut Society white paper provides best practices for use of newer, less invasive GERD treatments</a>'><sup>57</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-35" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-01-transoral-fundoplication-effective-treatment-patients.html" target="_blank">Transoral fundoplication is an effective treatment for patients with GERD</a>'><sup>35</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>On the pharmacological front, novel drugs like IW-3718 and Voquezna are under investigation. IW-3718, in combination with PPIs, has shown efficacy in reducing heartburn and regurgitation in patients with refractory GERD symptoms. Meanwhile, Voquezna, a potassium-competitive acid blocker, has exhibited higher healing rates in erosive esophagitis compared to traditional PPIs, marking it as a significant advancement in the pharmacological treatment of GERD<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-33" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-02-potential-heartburn-drug-vumc.html" target="_blank">Potential new heartburn drug studied at VUMC</a>'><sup>33</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-23" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-11-fda-voquezna-erosive-esophagitis-gerd.html" target="_blank">FDA approves Voquezna for erosive esophagitis, GERD</a>'><sup>23</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Antireflux mucosal ablation (ARMA) and antireflux mucosectomy (ARMS) are endoscopic techniques offering novel therapeutic benefits, particularly for patients with refractory GERD. These treatments have shown improvements in GERD health-related quality of life scores, acid exposure time, and endoscopic findings, although some procedures may result in transient complications such as stenosis<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-59" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-gerd-questionnaire-scores-antireflux-mucosectomy.html" target="_blank">Improved GERD questionnaire scores seen with antireflux mucosectomy</a>'><sup>59</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-72" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-11-antireflux-mucosal-ablation-safe-effective.html" target="_blank">Antireflux mucosal ablation safe, effective for refractory reflux disease</a>'><sup>72</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>A comprehensive understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms has also led to therapeutic developments. Recent studies highlight the potential role of inflammatory responses rather than mere acid presence in GERD-related esophageal damage. This insight opens avenues for targeting inflammatory mediators and cytokines as future therapeutic strategies<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-16" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-05-mechanism-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Surprising mechanism of acid reflux damage identified</a>'><sup>16</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, the recent innovations in GERD treatment reflect a move towards less invasive, more targeted interventions that address the underlying mechanisms of reflux disease rather than solely treating symptoms. Ongoing research will be crucial in optimizing these emerging therapies and integrating them into clinical practice to enhance patient outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="section-11">11. Understanding the Genetic Factors in Acid Reflux</h2>
<p>Genetic factors significantly influence susceptibility to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and related conditions such as Barrett&#x27;s Esophagus. Research has increasingly demonstrated that genetic predispositions play a critical role, challenging the previous assumption that GERD is solely influenced by lifestyle factors like diet and smoking<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-73" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-04-acid-reflux-genes.html" target="_blank">Acid reflux? It&#x27;s in the genes</a>'><sup>73</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. A study using a two-sample Mendelian randomization technique highlighted that approximately 76 genetic markers are linked to GERD, suggesting a marked hereditary component to the condition. This approach utilized genome-wide association study data from over 600,000 participants to establish robust associations between specific genetic variants and GERD<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-15" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-atrial-fibrillation.html" target="_blank">Gastroesophageal reflux disease increases risk for atrial fibrillation: Study</a>'><sup>15</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the genetic connection extends beyond GERD itself to associated diseases. For instance, genetic predispositions to GERD have been found to correlate with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. This correlation emphasizes an intricate genetic interplay where a genetic inclination toward GERD can potentially set the stage for other health complications<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-15" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-atrial-fibrillation.html" target="_blank">Gastroesophageal reflux disease increases risk for atrial fibrillation: Study</a>'><sup>15</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Additionally, research has identified genetic links between GERD and lung cancer, suggesting that individuals with GERD may have increased susceptibility to certain types of lung cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-13" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-12-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-causally-linked.html" target="_blank">Gastroesophageal reflux disease causally linked to lung cancer</a>'><sup>13</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Recognizing these genetic associations opens pathways for more personalized and potentially preventive strategies, including heightened surveillance and specific lifestyle interventions for genetically predisposed individuals.</p>
<p>Genetic variations can also affect how individuals respond to GERD treatments. For example, variants in the CYP2C19 gene influence how the body metabolizes proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), a standard treatment for GERD. Individuals with certain genotypes, particularly those classified as rapid metabolizers, may experience less effective acid suppression from PPIs, highlighting the need for genotype-guided therapy adjustments<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-38" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-11-cyp2c19-polymorphism-impacts-response-ppi.html" target="_blank">CYP2C19 polymorphism impacts response to PPI Tx in GERD</a>'><sup>38</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In the context of Barrettâ€™s Esophagus, which can result from prolonged acid exposure in the esophagus, research has uncovered genetic and cellular mechanisms at play. Barrett&#x27;s Esophagus is characterized by cellular transformation involving gastric cells acquiring intestinal characteristics, facilitated by specific proteins like HNF4A and CDX2 that drive intestinal gene expression in gastric cells. This genetic and cellular transformation underscores a complex interaction between genetic predispositions and the cellular response to environmental stressors like acid reflux<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-17" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-01-case-mistaken-identity-unmask-cellular.html" target="_blank">A case of mistaken identity: Researchers unmask cellular source of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus</a>'><sup>17</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-12">12. Safety and Efficacy of Magnetic Devices for GERD</h2>
<p>The LINX Reflux Management System, an FDA-approved device, represents a significant advancement in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), offering an alternative to traditional pharmaceutical and surgical interventions. This device utilizes a series of titanium beads with magnetic cores to form a ring that is implanted at the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The system addresses the primary cause of GERD by supporting and enhancing the function of the LES, reducing or eliminating the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus. The device operates by staying closed to prevent reflux while allowing normal swallowing by opening during food passage, thus closely replicating the function of a healthy LES<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-36" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-effectiveness-magnetic-device-treatment-reflux.html" target="_blank">Study shows effectiveness of magnetic device for treatment of reflux disease</a>'><sup>36</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-54" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-04-implanted-bracelet-chronic-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Implanted &#x27;bracelet&#x27; helps treat chronic heartburn (Update 2)</a>'><sup>54</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-bracelet-like-device-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Bracelet-like device controls chronic acid reflux, study finds</a>'><sup>4</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Clinical studies have consistently shown the LINX system to be both safe and effective for GERD management.

<h2 id="section-13">13. GERD and Sleep: Managing Night-time Symptoms</h2>
<p>Managing night-time symptoms of GERD requires a multifaceted approach, integrating lifestyle changes, dietary modifications, and non-pharmacological interventions. One of the key strategies is utilizing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). CPAP has shown to notably alleviate nocturnal acid reflux symptoms by keeping the airway open and reducing the occurrence of acid reflux events during sleep. Studies suggest a significant reduction in heartburn scores and other respiratory symptoms among users, indicating its potential effectiveness without heavy reliance on medications<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-76" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-10-cpap-therapy-acid-reflux-people.html" target="_blank">Study finds that CPAP therapy reduces acid reflux in people with sleep apnea</a>'><sup>76</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-77" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-treatment-problematic-night-time-heartburn-respiratory.html" target="_blank">Treatment for problematic snoring can also reduce night-time heartburn and respiratory symptoms</a>'><sup>77</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Another promising intervention is the EsophyX procedure, a non-invasive surgical option that creates an anti-reflux barrier and has resulted in a high percentage of patients discontinuing proton-pump inhibitors due to symptom resolution. This incision-free method not only minimizes recovery time but also reduces medication-related side effects, improving sleep quality for individuals suffering from frequent reflux<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-5" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-incision-free-surgery-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">New incision-free surgery helps tame chronic acid reflux</a>'><sup>5</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Dietary changes also play a pivotal role in managing nocturnal GERD symptoms. Shifting to a Mediterranean-style diet rich in fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts, while avoiding dairy and meats, has proven particularly effective. This plant-based approach can significantly reduce reflux symptoms and improve overall health, potentially offering a viable alternative to medication<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-66" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-09-mediterranean-style-diet-reflux-medications.html" target="_blank">Mediterranean-style diet may eliminate need for reflux medications</a>'><sup>66</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Additionally, timing meals wisely by avoiding large, late-night meals can help prevent nighttime heartburn. Consuming a main meal earlier in the day and avoiding eating within three hours before bedtime are recommended strategies<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-53" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-12-holiday-heartburn-gastroenterologist.html" target="_blank">Tips on how to avoid holiday heartburn from a gastroenterologist</a>'><sup>53</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-63" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-12-expert-holiday-feasting-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert tips for holiday feasting without the heartburn</a>'><sup>63</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity, and avoiding smoking are also integral. These changes contribute to improved digestive health and can significantly mitigate the risk and intensity of GERD symptoms during sleep. Limiting the intake of caffeinated beverages and alcohol, along with managing stress through techniques like mindfulness or cognitive behavioral therapy, can further help in reducing gut hypersensitivity and related discomfort<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>For patients where lifestyle adjustments are insufficient, or when symptoms persist, consulting with a healthcare provider is crucial.

<h2 id="section-14">14. The Connection Between GERD and Respiratory Conditions</h2>
<p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has a significant connection with various respiratory conditions, predominantly due to the potential for stomach contents to move upward into the esophagus and enter the respiratory tract. This occurrence can lead to respiratory symptoms and, in more severe cases, conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic bronchitis. Recent studies have demonstrated a noteworthy link between GERD and IPF. A study involving a large sample size found that individuals with GERD have an increased risk of developing IPF. The research suggested a causal relationship, emphasizing the influence of GERD on the health and function of the lungs, although IPF does not seem to increase GERD risk<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-78" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-05-gerd-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis.html" target="_blank">GERD increases risk for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</a>'><sup>78</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, GERD can complicate respiratory health by exacerbating nocturnal symptoms in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The leakage of stomach acids into the esophagus can intensify symptoms like night-time heartburn, coughing, and wheezing, which are prevalent among OSA patients. The use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy has been shown to reduce these symptoms significantly. CPAP not only helps with sleep apnea but it also maintains the closure of the esophagogastric junction, thereby preventing acid reflux during sleep and improving associated respiratory symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-77" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-treatment-problematic-night-time-heartburn-respiratory.html" target="_blank">Treatment for problematic snoring can also reduce night-time heartburn and respiratory symptoms</a>'><sup>77</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>GERD&#x27;s impact is also evident in asthma patients, as refluxed material can contribute to respiratory symptoms that mimic or worsen asthma, such as wheezing and coughing. Many asthma patients may unknowingly suffer from GERD, with symptoms often proving resistant to traditional asthma treatments unless GERD is also addressed. Surgical interventions designed to mitigate reflux can benefit patients who experience respiratory problems due to GERD masquerading as asthma<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-uncontrolled-asthma-symptoms-stomach.html" target="_blank">Uncontrolled asthma symptoms may start in the stomach</a>'><sup>14</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-79" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-10-asthma-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Is there a connection between asthma and acid reflux?</a>'><sup>79</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Anti-reflux surgery has been specifically highlighted for its role in improving lung function in patients with pulmonary diseases. Conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome have shown improvements following such surgical interventions, particularly noticeable in lung transplant patients. The surgery appears to reduce the potential for gastric fluid aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia or acute rejection episodes in transplanted lungs<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-80" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-09-anti-reflux-surgery-airway-function-lung.html" target="_blank">Anti-reflux surgery helps airway function both before and after lung transplant</a>'><sup>80</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, managing GERD through dietary changes, lifestyle adjustments, or treatments like CPAP can substantially benefit respiratory health. For those with coexisting asthma or OSA, addressing GERD could alleviate respiratory symptoms and enhance quality of life. Understanding the intricate relationship between GERD and respiratory conditions is crucial for tailoring effective treatment strategies in patients experiencing overlapping symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-77" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-treatment-problematic-night-time-heartburn-respiratory.html" target="_blank">Treatment for problematic snoring can also reduce night-time heartburn and respiratory symptoms</a>'><sup>77</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-uncontrolled-asthma-symptoms-stomach.html" target="_blank">Uncontrolled asthma symptoms may start in the stomach</a>'><sup>14</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-80" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-09-anti-reflux-surgery-airway-function-lung.html" target="_blank">Anti-reflux surgery helps airway function both before and after lung transplant</a>'><sup>80</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-15">15. GERD and Esophageal Cancer Risk</h2>
<p>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a known risk factor for the development of esophageal cancer, particularly esophageal adenocarcinoma. The increase in risk is closely linked to a condition known as Barrett&#x27;s Esophagus, which can develop as a result of chronic exposure to stomach acid due to GERD. Barrettâ€™s Esophagus involves changes in the cells lining the esophagus, which can become precancerous over time<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-81" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-05-national-group-cancer-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">National group wants cancer warning labels on acid reflux drugs</a>'><sup>81</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-17" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-01-case-mistaken-identity-unmask-cellular.html" target="_blank">A case of mistaken identity: Researchers unmask cellular source of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus</a>'><sup>17</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-07-untreated-heartburn-esophageal-cancer.html" target="_blank">Untreated heartburn may raise risk for esophageal cancer, study says</a>'><sup>10</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-gerd-heartburn.html" target="_blank">GERD is not &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>2</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Research and advocacy groups have called for greater awareness regarding the cancer risks associated with long-term GERD, especially among those who develop Barrettâ€™s Esophagus. This condition significantly increases the risk of esophageal cancer, although cancer develops in only a small percentage of patients with Barrett&#x27;s Esophagus (1-5%)<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-82" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-06-combining-heartburn-drugs-aspirin-oesophageal.html" target="_blank">Combining heartburn drugs and aspirin could prevent oesophageal cancer in people at high risk</a>'><sup>82</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-expert-reflux-disease-isnt-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert explains why reflux disease isn&#x27;t &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>1</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. It has been shown that managing GERD through medications or surgical interventions can potentially reduce the risk of esophageal cancer. For instance, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), when used consistently, have been linked to a reduction in the progression to cancer in patients with Barrett&#x27;s Esophagus<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-82" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-06-combining-heartburn-drugs-aspirin-oesophageal.html" target="_blank">Combining heartburn drugs and aspirin could prevent oesophageal cancer in people at high risk</a>'><sup>82</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-expert-reflux-disease-isnt-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert explains why reflux disease isn&#x27;t &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>1</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The role of bile and not just acid in contributing to Barrettâ€™s Esophagus and the subsequent risk of esophageal cancer has been highlighted in recent studies, pointing to the importance of addressing this factor in treatment plans<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-18" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-04-bile-acid-bad-guy.html" target="_blank">Bile - not acid - is bad guy in triggering precancerous condition associated with reflux disease</a>'><sup>18</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Additionally, the genetic basis of Barrettâ€™s Esophagus indicates that some individuals may be genetically predisposed to develop this condition, which could lead to cancer if not managed properly<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-73" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-04-acid-reflux-genes.html" target="_blank">Acid reflux?

<h2 id="section-16">16. Comparing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 Blockers</h2>
<p>Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 blockers are two principal classes of medications used for managing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) through the reduction of stomach acid production, albeit through different mechanisms. PPIs work by irreversibly blocking the proton pump in gastric parietal cells, which leads to a significant and prolonged suppression of gastric acid secretion, making them particularly effective for severe GERD cases and in healing erosive esophagitis<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-6" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-09-device-gastroesophageal-reflux-stapling-stomach.html" target="_blank">Device treats gastroesophageal reflux by stapling stomach to esophagus through mouth</a>'><sup>6</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In contrast, H2 blockers inhibit the action of histamine at the H2 receptors of the stomach lining, resulting in decreased production of gastric acid. This mechanism does not lead to as profound a reduction in acid secretion as PPIs and generally has a shorter duration of action. However, H2 blockers can act more quickly than PPIs, which might be beneficial in providing rapid relief of heartburn symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-expert-reflux-disease-isnt-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert explains why reflux disease isn&#x27;t &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>1</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.

However, careful evaluation of side effects and patient-specific factors is crucial.</p>
<p>While these medications serve as critical tools in managing GERD, optimizing patient outcomes often involves considering non-pharmacological strategies alongside medication. Individualized treatments based on patient history, risks, and lifestyle adjustments may play a substantial role in effectively controlling GERD symptoms without necessitating long-term reliance on either class of drugs<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-6" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-09-device-gastroesophageal-reflux-stapling-stomach.html" target="_blank">Device treats gastroesophageal reflux by stapling stomach to esophagus through mouth</a>'><sup>6</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-17">17. Bile Versus Acid in Reflux Disease</h2>
<p>Recent research has increasingly highlighted the significant role of bile, rather than acid, in the progression of certain gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) complications, such as Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is a condition that heightens the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, a serious cancer type. Conventional GERD treatments, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), primarily aim to reduce acid production, potentially overlooking the harmful impact of bile reflux. Bile has been shown to obstruct the regular growth of esophageal cells and foster the growth of intestinal-like cells, which are indicative of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. This discovery prompts a reconsideration of the pathways leading to Barrett&#x27;s esophagus and propels the search for therapies that specifically target bile reflux to prevent its development<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-18" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-04-bile-acid-bad-guy.html" target="_blank">Bile - not acid - is bad guy in triggering precancerous condition associated with reflux disease</a>'><sup>18</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The prevalence of obesity, which correlates with rising GERD rates, may exacerbate bile-related complications such as Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. This association underscores the urgency of public health initiatives focusing on obesity management as a preventive measure against GERD-related complications. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which bile affects esophageal cells could pave the way toward novel therapeutic strategies that effectively manage GERD and mitigate its complications<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-18" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-04-bile-acid-bad-guy.html" target="_blank">Bile - not acid - is bad guy in triggering precancerous condition associated with reflux disease</a>'><sup>18</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Current advancements in drug research have started focusing more on bile acids and their role in GERD. A novel investigational drug, IW-3718, is designed to bind with bile acids in the stomach, and when used alongside PPIs, it may offer a promising solution for patients whose GERD symptoms persist despite standard treatments. In clinical trials involving patients with treatment-resistant GERD, IW-3718 significantly alleviated heartburn and regurgitation symptoms, illustrating its potential as a bile acid-targeting therapy. These findings advocate for a broader approach in managing GERD that includes addressing bile acids, thereby offering hope to patients who remain symptomatic under conventional therapeutic regimens<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-33" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-02-potential-heartburn-drug-vumc.html" target="_blank">Potential new heartburn drug studied at VUMC</a>'><sup>33</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-18">18. Investigating the Use of CPAP Therapy in Reflux Management</h2>
<p>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy has garnered attention for its potential role in managing nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, particularly in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The CPAP device, which is traditionally used to maintain airflow in individuals with OSA during sleep, has been observed to have beneficial effects on reducing night-time heartburn and respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing. According to findings from the Icelandic Sleep Apnea Cohort study, which included 822 participants, regular use of CPAP therapy led to a 42% reduction in the incidence of night-time heartburn among its users. This indicates that CPAP could effectively assist in reducing acid reflux symptoms, subsequently decreasing the risks associated with morning cough and chronic bronchitis<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-77" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-treatment-problematic-night-time-heartburn-respiratory.html" target="_blank">Treatment for problematic snoring can also reduce night-time heartburn and respiratory symptoms</a>'><sup>77</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The mechanics behind CPAP&#x27;s efficacy may lie in its ability to promote the closure of the gastroesophageal junction, acting as a barrier to prevent acid leakage from the stomach into the esophagus during sleep. This implies that patients who suffer from night-time reflux symptoms in conjunction with OSA might benefit from undergoing CPAP therapy. Thus, it is recommended for individuals exhibiting these symptoms to be evaluated for potential OSA as part of their treatment regimen<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-77" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-treatment-problematic-night-time-heartburn-respiratory.html" target="_blank">Treatment for problematic snoring can also reduce night-time heartburn and respiratory symptoms</a>'><sup>77</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Further supporting these findings, another study with 79 participants highlighted the impact of CPAP adherence on acid reflux management. A significant number of these patients (78%) initially reported acid reflux symptoms. The study revealed that those adhering to CPAP therapy experienced a notable 62% reduction in mean heartburn scores. It also determined that adherence to CPAP, specifically utilizing the device for a minimum of 4 hours on at least 25% of the nights, was the sole predictor of reduced acid reflux symptoms. This suggests that consistent use of CPAP might alleviate nocturnal acid reflux symptoms effectively, reducing the dependence on acid-reducing medications for managing these symptoms in patients with OSA<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-76" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-10-cpap-therapy-acid-reflux-people.html" target="_blank">Study finds that CPAP therapy reduces acid reflux in people with sleep apnea</a>'><sup>76</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Given the promising results from these studies, CPAP therapy may represent an important non-pharmacological option for managing nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, especially in individuals who concurrently suffer from obstructive sleep apnea. This could potentially offer relief to patients without the adverse effects associated with long-term medication use, underscoring the need for further research and consideration in clinical practice<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-77" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-treatment-problematic-night-time-heartburn-respiratory.html" target="_blank">Treatment for problematic snoring can also reduce night-time heartburn and respiratory symptoms</a>'><sup>77</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-76" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-10-cpap-therapy-acid-reflux-people.html" target="_blank">Study finds that CPAP therapy reduces acid reflux in people with sleep apnea</a>'><sup>76</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-19">19. Surgical Options: Anti-Reflux Mucosectomy and Fundoplication</h2>
<p>For patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who do not respond to pharmacological treatments, surgical interventions such as fundoplication and anti-reflux mucosectomy (ARMS) present viable options. Fundoplication, particularly the laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, involves wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophagus to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter, thus preventing acid reflux. It has shown significant efficacy in improving symptoms, with 67% of patients experiencing relief compared to those treated with medications or placebos<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-34" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-surgery-tough-to-treat-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Surgery helps tough-to-treat acid reflux</a>'><sup>34</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Despite its efficacy, fundoplication is associated with possible side effects like difficulties in belching and vomiting due to the creation of a robust valve<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-34" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-surgery-tough-to-treat-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Surgery helps tough-to-treat acid reflux</a>'><sup>34</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery generally demonstrates fewer postoperative complications and promotes faster recovery than open surgery, making it a preferred choice at specialized centers<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-56" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-01-laparoscopic-anti-reflux-gerd-linked-postoperative.html" target="_blank">Laparoscopic anti-reflux operation for GERD linked to fewer postoperative complications</a>'><sup>56</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Moreover, fundoplication can be considered for patients post-endoscopic procedures like peroral endoscopic myotomy if GERD symptoms develop<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-86" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-antireflux-surgery-gerd-endoscopy.html" target="_blank">When antireflux surgery is needed to treat GERD after endoscopy</a>'><sup>86</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, ARMS, a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure, has been increasingly recognized for its long-term effectiveness, especially in patients refractory to proton pump inhibitors or those with reflux hypersensitivity. In a study involving 88 patients undergoing ARMS, 68.3% achieved long-term symptom relief with a significant number able to discontinue use of PPIs<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-58" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-06-anti-reflux-mucosectomy-effective-gerd-term.html" target="_blank">Anti-reflux mucosectomy effective for GERD in long term</a>'><sup>58</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Additional studies found that ARMS leads to significant improvements in GERD questionnaire scores, which are metrics used to assess symptom severity<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-59" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-07-gerd-questionnaire-scores-antireflux-mucosectomy.html" target="_blank">Improved GERD questionnaire scores seen with antireflux mucosectomy</a>'><sup>59</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>When comparing ARMS to other similar interventions, such as antireflux mucosal ablation (ARMA), ARMS appears to yield better symptom control and reflux esophagitis improvements, despite higher bleeding rates. Both ARMS and ARMA show equivalent success in resolving Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, a potential complication of GERD<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-60" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-antireflux-mucosectomy-mucosal-ablation-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Antireflux mucosectomy, mucosal ablation compared for gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>'><sup>60</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>It is crucial to carefully select candidates for surgical interventions as not all patients may benefit from such procedures. Those who only experience hypersensitivity or functional heartburn might not obtain relief through surgery and could even see their quality of life negatively impacted<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-69" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-invasive-procedures-reserved-sub-group-acid.html" target="_blank">Invasive procedures should be reserved for a sub-group of acid reflux patients, study says</a>'><sup>69</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.

<h2 id="section-20">20. How Common Medications Affect GERD Management</h2>
<p>Various common medications have a significant impact on managing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used due to their ability to suppress gastric acid production, which can help manage GERD symptoms for many patients. However, PPIs do not address the mechanical dysfunction at the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which is a primary factor in acid reflux. Consequently, patients may continue to experience symptoms despite medication use, which necessitates consideration of alternative strategies or complementary treatments<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-bracelet-like-device-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Bracelet-like device controls chronic acid reflux, study finds</a>'><sup>4</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>One concern with PPIs is their association with several potential adverse effects. They have been linked to chronic kidney disease and kidney failure, especially with long-term use. Studies have shown that PPI users have a higher risk of renal complications compared to those using H2 blockers<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-40" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-03-ties-common-heartburn-medications-kidney.html" target="_blank">Research ties common heartburn medications to kidney disease and failure</a>'><sup>40</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-42" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-commonly-reflux-ulcer-medication-kidney.html" target="_blank">Commonly used reflux and ulcer medication may cause serious kidney damage</a>'><sup>42</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. In addition, PPIs can lead to nutrient malabsorption, including deficiencies in calcium and iron, which could potentially contribute to other health issues like fractures and anemia<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-5" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-incision-free-surgery-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">New incision-free surgery helps tame chronic acid reflux</a>'><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-39" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-10-heartburn-treatments-depress-body-iron.html" target="_blank">Some heartburn treatments depress body iron levels, study finds</a>'><sup>39</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Beyond PPIs, other commonly used medications also play a role in exacerbating GERD symptoms. Certain muscle relaxants and medications used for high blood pressure can contribute to reflux by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter, thus allowing acid to creep back into the esophagus<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-53" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-12-holiday-heartburn-gastroenterologist.html" target="_blank">Tips on how to avoid holiday heartburn from a gastroenterologist</a>'><sup>53</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. This indicates the need for patients and healthcare providers to review all medications being taken for potential interactions and explore alternatives that might mitigate reflux symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-53" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-12-holiday-heartburn-gastroenterologist.html" target="_blank">Tips on how to avoid holiday heartburn from a gastroenterologist</a>'><sup>53</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, alternatives to traditional medical therapies are continually being explored. Surgical interventions, like laparoscopic fundoplication, address the physical mechanisms of GERD by enhancing the function of the LES. These procedures, while more invasive than drug therapy, can result in better control of GERD symptoms and potentially eliminate the need for long-term medication use<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-55" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-03-low-risk-surgery-chronic-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Could a low-risk surgery help your chronic heartburn?</a>'><sup>55</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-34" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-surgery-tough-to-treat-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Surgery helps tough-to-treat acid reflux</a>'><sup>34</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Newer treatments like magnetic beads (e.g., the LINX device) or electrical stimulation of the LES offer less invasive options than traditional surgery and may also provide significant amelioration for those inadequately managed by medication alone<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-bracelet-like-device-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Bracelet-like device controls chronic acid reflux, study finds</a>'><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-70" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-09-magnets-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Magnets help cure chronic acid reflux</a>'><sup>70</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Lifestyle factors also augment or impede GERD management involving medications. Weight management, dietary modifications, and physical activity have been shown to significantly reduce symptoms and enhance the effectiveness of medications for some patients, even leading to reduced reliance on such treatments<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, effective GERD management is multifaceted, necessitating a combination of pharmacological, surgical, and lifestyle interventions tailored to the individual needs of patients. As research continues, the integration of novel therapies alongside conventional treatments may offer better safety profiles and improve quality of life for GERD patients<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-57" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-05-american-foregut-society-white-paper.html" target="_blank">American Foregut Society white paper provides best practices for use of newer, less invasive GERD treatments</a>'><sup>57</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-21">21. The Influence of Diet and Sugars in GERD</h2>
<p>Diet plays a crucial role in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), with certain dietary components both exacerbating and alleviating symptoms. Research suggests that one way to potentially control GERD symptoms is by reducing the intake of simple sugars. A study from Vanderbilt University showed that participants who lowered their simple sugar consumption experienced improved esophageal acid pH and a decreased number of reflux episodes. The study highlighted that even modest reductions in simple sugar intake can lead to significant health benefits, including decreased reliance on medications and improved overall symptom management<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-62" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-intake-simple-sugars-gerd.html" target="_blank">Study finds that reducing intake of simple sugars improves GERD</a>'><sup>62</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to focusing on sugars, adopting a dietary pattern akin to the Mediterranean-style diet has shown promise in managing GERD symptoms. This diet is predominantly plant-based, rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and encourages the avoidance of dairy and meat products. A study published in JAMA Otolaryngology indicated that patients adhering to a Mediterranean-style diet, complemented by alkaline water, reported significant reductions in their reflux symptoms. This dietary approach was found to be as effective as using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in reducing symptom severity. Such dietary modifications not only target GERD symptoms but also contribute to overall improved health metrics like weight management and cardiovascular health<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-66" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-09-mediterranean-style-diet-reflux-medications.html" target="_blank">Mediterranean-style diet may eliminate need for reflux medications</a>'><sup>66</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, general dietary guidelines suggest that making informed choices can significantly impact GERD outcomes. Seeking the expertise of a registered dietitian can help individuals tailor their dietary habits to better manage their symptoms. Specific strategies may include meal timing and portion control, such as avoiding large meals and not eating close to bedtime, which can help mitigate symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-87" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-11-gerd-symptoms.html" target="_blank">Got GERD? eat this way to help avoid symptoms</a>'><sup>87</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-88" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-reflux-meals-holiday-season.html" target="_blank">How to avoid reflux after meals this holiday season</a>'><sup>88</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. The Nurses&#x27; Health Study also supports the synergy between diet and lifestyle, showing a marked reduction in GERD symptoms amongst women who adhered to a &#x27;prudent&#x27; diet and engaged in other healthy lifestyle practices.

<h2 id="section-22">22. How Asthma and GERD Intersect</h2>
<p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and asthma often present concurrently, complicating the management of both conditions. Indeed, GERD can have a significant impact on respiratory health, as stomach contents can reflux into the airways, leading to symptoms that resemble or exacerbate asthma, such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. This phenomenon is particularly concerning as it can mimic persistent asthma symptoms that may not respond well to traditional asthma therapies. The reflux-induced respiratory symptoms are often due to a dysfunction of the esophageal sphincter, which allows stomach acid and contents to travel upward into the airway. If this condition is left untreated, it can potentially result in severe lung damage, including scarring, and increase the risk for esophageal cancer or even necessitate lung transplantation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-uncontrolled-asthma-symptoms-stomach.html" target="_blank">Uncontrolled asthma symptoms may start in the stomach</a>'><sup>14</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The coexistence of asthma and GERD is not entirely understood, yet it is recognized that each condition can influence and exacerbate the other. It has been noted that approximately 50% of children who have asthma also suffer from GERD, indicating a significant overlap between the two conditions. In both adults and children, managing this combination can be particularly challenging as the presence of one condition can make the symptoms of the other less controllable. Addressing acid reflux symptoms may provide some relief from asthma-like symptoms. Over-the-counter medications such as proton pump inhibitors have proved beneficial in this regard. However, if these are insufficient, prescription medications might be necessary<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-79" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-10-asthma-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Is there a connection between asthma and acid reflux?</a>'><sup>79</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Careful management is crucial, as some asthma medications, such as theophylline, might actually worsen acid reflux symptoms. Therefore, modifications in medication should only occur under medical supervision to avoid exacerbating reflux-related respiratory symptoms<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-79" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-10-asthma-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Is there a connection between asthma and acid reflux?</a>'><sup>79</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. A multidisciplinary approach involving lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, and potentially surgical interventions can effectively address lung issues caused by GERD, highlighting the importance of considering GERD in patients with asthma-like symptoms that do not respond to conventional treatments. There is evidence to suggest that many patients experience significant improvements in their respiratory symptoms after receiving appropriate treatment for GERD<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-uncontrolled-asthma-symptoms-stomach.html" target="_blank">Uncontrolled asthma symptoms may start in the stomach</a>'><sup>14</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. This underscores the necessity for healthcare providers to recognize and address the potential link between GERD and unresolved respiratory issues, as early and targeted treatment can prevent potential long-term damage<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-uncontrolled-asthma-symptoms-stomach.html" target="_blank">Uncontrolled asthma symptoms may start in the stomach</a>'><sup>14</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-23">23. The Role of the Esophagus in GERD</h2>
<p>The esophagus plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), as it is directly impacted by the malfunctioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a critical muscular valve that separates the stomach from the esophagus. When the LES functions properly, it prevents the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus. However, if this sphincter is weakened or relaxes inappropriately, it allows acid to escape into the esophagus, which can lead to symptoms such as heartburn, pain, and regurgitation<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-4" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-bracelet-like-device-chronic-acid-reflux.html" target="_blank">Bracelet-like device controls chronic acid reflux, study finds</a>'><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-37" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-electrical-esophagus-treatment-unresolved-reflux.html" target="_blank">Electrical stimulation of the esophagus promising treatment for unresolved reflux symptoms</a>'><sup>37</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Chronic exposure of the esophageal lining to stomach acid can cause significant injury, resulting in complications such as esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus) and Barrettâ€™s esophagus, a condition where the normal esophageal lining is replaced by a lining similar to that of the intestine. This transformation is an adaptive response to protect the esophagus from acidic damage but increases the risk for esophageal cancer<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-expert-reflux-disease-isnt-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert explains why reflux disease isn&#x27;t &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-18" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-04-bile-acid-bad-guy.html" target="_blank">Bile - not acid - is bad guy in triggering precancerous condition associated with reflux disease</a>'><sup>18</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Barrettâ€™s esophagus develops in 10% to 15% of GERD patients, though only a small percentage progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma, underscoring the need for vigilant monitoring and early intervention in high-risk individuals<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-expert-reflux-disease-isnt-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert explains why reflux disease isn&#x27;t &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>1</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, recent research challenges the traditional view that acid is the primary irritant in GERD. Evidence suggests that bile, rather than acid, plays a significant role in the development of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, especially considering its potent capacity to alter the esophageal cellular environment. Bile exposure encourages the growth of acid-resistant, intestinal-like cells over the typical esophageal lining, making targeted treatment of bile reflux an important focus for future therapeutic strategies<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-18" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-04-bile-acid-bad-guy.html" target="_blank">Bile - not acid - is bad guy in triggering precancerous condition associated with reflux disease</a>'><sup>18</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Various innovations aimed at restoring the function of the LES and the esophagus have emerged. For instance, electrical stimulation of the LES has demonstrated promise in reducing medication reliance and improving quality of life among patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by conventional therapies. By strengthening the LES, patients are better protected from acid exposure<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-37" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-10-electrical-esophagus-treatment-unresolved-reflux.html" target="_blank">Electrical stimulation of the esophagus promising treatment for unresolved reflux symptoms</a>'><sup>37</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Moreover, newer surgical devices, like the Medigus MUSE System, have been developed to mechanically reinforce the barrier between the stomach and esophagus, providing minimally invasive, long-term solutions to GERD<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-6" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-09-device-gastroesophageal-reflux-stapling-stomach.html" target="_blank">Device treats gastroesophageal reflux by stapling stomach to esophagus through mouth</a>'><sup>6</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Understanding the role of the esophagus extends beyond the physical aspects to include lifestyle and dietary influences, which affect the pressure exerted on the LES and esophageal functioning. Therefore, integrating lifestyle modifications along with these innovative treatments could provide comprehensive management of GERD symptoms and prevent further esophageal damage<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-7" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-diet-lifestyle-guidelines-greatly-gastroesophageal.html" target="_blank">Diet and lifestyle guidelines can greatly reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms</a>'><sup>7</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="section-24">24. Technological Advances in Assessing GERD</h2>
<p>The landscape of assessing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is continually evolving, with technology playing a pivotal role in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient care. Among the latest innovations is the development of high-resolution manometry (HRM) scores, such as the Milan Score, which offer a novel approach to assessing the risk and severity of GERD. This score has been meticulously crafted and validated through rigorous research led by Dr. Stefano Siboni and his team at IRCCS Policlinico San Donato. By evaluating specific parameters like the straight leg raise response and esophagogastric junction subtype 3, the Milan Score demonstrated a significant predictive capacity with an odds ratio of 18.20 and 3.87, respectively. The efficacy of the Milan Score was further corroborated in an external validation cohort, achieving a corrected Harrel c-index of 0.90. This promising tool provides a potential breakthrough in GERD screening, streamlining diagnostic pathways and facilitating more personalized treatment strategies for patients, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-89" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-05-score-validated-diagnosis-gastroesophageal-reflux.html" target="_blank">Novel score validated for diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>'><sup>89</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In addition, advancements in digital technology have led to the development of tools that specifically target associated conditions such as Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, which often stems from chronic GERD. Traditional methods of monitoring Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, like the Seattle protocol, are invasive and may not always be effective in identifying problematic tissues. Addressing this limitation, researchers have developed a digital tool that incorporates a computational model to simulate the human esophagus for improved monitoring. This innovative approach leverages historical data and real-world statistics to allow virtual examinations of various tissue types. By minimizing invasiveness and enhancing precision, this tool aims to improve the monitoring process for Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, thereby potentially reducing the risks of progression to esophageal cancerâ€”a serious consequence for some GERD patients<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-90" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-11-digital-tool-barrett-esophagus.html" target="_blank">New digital tool to better monitor Barrett&#x27;s esophagus</a>'><sup>90</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>These technological strides signify a critical advancement in how GERD and its related conditions are assessed and managed. By integrating sophisticated diagnostic tools like the Milan Score and the digital monitoring model for Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, the healthcare landscape can be transformed, leading to enhanced accuracy in diagnosis, improved patient comfort, and ultimately, better health outcomes for those affected by GERD and its complications.</p>

<h2 id="section-25">25. Long-Term Health Implications of GERD</h2>
<p>The long-term health implications of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are profound and manifold, affecting various aspects of patient health and quality of life. GERD is associated with several significant complications if not managed appropriately over time. One of the primary concerns is the potential development of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, a condition where the lining of the esophagus adapts to form a defense against frequent acid exposure, leading to an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a type of esophageal cancer. This risk accentuates the necessity for regular monitoring and timely interventions to prevent progression to malignancy<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-expert-reflux-disease-isnt-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert explains why reflux disease isn&#x27;t &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-gerd-heartburn.html" target="_blank">GERD is not &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-10" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-07-untreated-heartburn-esophageal-cancer.html" target="_blank">Untreated heartburn may raise risk for esophageal cancer, study says</a>'><sup>10</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Barrett&#x27;s esophagus itself is a result of chronic GERD-related changes in the intestinal-like columnar epithelium in the lower esophagus, a transformation thought to be partly driven by bile reflux, which traditional acid-reducing treatments like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) might not adequately address<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-18" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-04-bile-acid-bad-guy.html" target="_blank">Bile - not acid - is bad guy in triggering precancerous condition associated with reflux disease</a>'><sup>18</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-17" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-01-case-mistaken-identity-unmask-cellular.html" target="_blank">A case of mistaken identity: Researchers unmask cellular source of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus</a>'><sup>17</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Research highlights the role of bile, along with acid, in exacerbating these changes within the esophageal lining. Consequently, addressing bile reflux might be essential in reducing the risks associated with GERD and preventing complications such as Barrett&#x27;s esophagus<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-18" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-04-bile-acid-bad-guy.html" target="_blank">Bile - not acid - is bad guy in triggering precancerous condition associated with reflux disease</a>'><sup>18</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Aside from esophageal cancer, untreated GERD can lead to severe inflammation known as esophagitis, which may cause strictures due to scarring<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-1" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-expert-reflux-disease-isnt-heartburn.html" target="_blank">Expert explains why reflux disease isn&#x27;t &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#citation-2" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-11-gerd-heartburn.html" target="_blank">GERD is not &#x27;just&#x27; heartburn</a>'><sup>2</sup></a><sup>]</sup>. Moreover, GERD has been shown to impact respiratory health, causing symptoms that mimic asthma due to micro-aspiration of stomach contents into the lungs<sup>[</sup><a href="#citation-14" class="citation-link" data-tippy-content='<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-11-uncontrolled-asthma-symptoms-stomach.html" target="_blank">Uncontrolled asthma symptoms may start in the stomach</a>'><sup>14</sup></a><sup>]</sup>.
