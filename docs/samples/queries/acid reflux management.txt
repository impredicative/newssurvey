I want to know everything about treating and managing acid reflux (GERD / NERD). Reflux is especially a problem at night when the esophagus is most susceptible to damage. Cover all angles, not limited to medications, lifestyle, nutrition, supplements, surgeries, etc.

From a medication pov, skip advising PPIs (proton pump inhibitors), however, as we know that they have numerous side effects. H2 antagonists such as famotidine are okay to include though. As for antacids such as calcium carbonate, the commercial products contain too many harmful sweeteners and additives.

From a lifestyle pov, I wonder if abdominal fat loss helps. With regard to sleep, I wonder if it helps to sleep on a particular side.

From a nutrition pov, I have heard that fiber helps, not limited to psyllium husk. I have also heard that avoiding late night consumption also helps. Other than this, if you find info relating caffeine/coffee/tea and/or alcohol to reflux, you can cover that too.

From a supplements pov, I recall reading that melatonin could help.

Do not limit the response to the few points that came to my mind above. With regard to managing acid reflux, also cover any associated tips for esophageal health. Bile reflux too is of relevance.
