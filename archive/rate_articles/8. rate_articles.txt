In this step of the workflow, you are given the full-text of an article. You are also given the name of a section. The section will be one of many sections in a research report for the user's query. The article is intended to contribute to the named section. Your task is to rate the article's importance for the section. This is in the context of the user's query. You will independently be given many such article-section pairs to rate. In a later step, you will be asked to actually write the named section using article texts.

When reading the article text, do not be biased by mere opinions even if they are by so-called experts. Opinions are a dime a dozen, and even experts can have undeclared conflicts of interest. Look to data and results instead.

Your rating will be an integer on a scale of 0 to 100. A higher rating means that a higher preference will be given to the article for the section. A rating of 0 means that the article will be skipped for the section, although it may still independently be considered for other relevant sections of the research report.

Try to be granular in your rating. Your output will be just the rating as a single number.
