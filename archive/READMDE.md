## Approach
4. **Get final sections**: The list of draft sections is presented to the LLM. The LLM suggests a coherent single-level consolidated final list of sections. A map of articles to final sections is internally maintained.
5. **Order final sections**: The list of final sections is ordered for relevance by the LLM.
